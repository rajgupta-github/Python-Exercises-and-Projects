"Amazing parents Andrew and Sarah are raising funds to help their
  beautiful twin boys Freddie and Louie, and other children suffering
  from the rare, degenerative condition, CLN5 Batten disease. Freddie and Louie Dawkins are the only known twins in the world with
  this rare form of a rare disease. Born perfectly healthy in 2005, they
  became autistic, blind and recently developed epilepsy. When they were
  diagnosed in 2009, doctors said that without major advancements in
  medical science, there was no hope, no treatment and no cure. In February 2014 Andrew and Sarah decided to fight back through
  ‘Battle Batten’ their very own campaign to exclusively raise money for
  research into CLN5 Batten disease. Originally aiming for just £1,000, they have so far raised an
  incredible £80,000 and unbelievably commissioned two research
  projects. They are the first UK family to privately commission
  research into CLN5 Batten disease; donating funds to the Batten
  Disease Family Association (BDFA), a charity who is managing the
  projects on the family’s behalf. The cash raised in just 12 months has been unexpected, and
  emotionally overwhelming for the family and still, the momentum and
  passion is strong. The family will continue to fundraise for as long
  as they can. Proceeds will be donated to research projects and will
  buy equipment that best offers hope to children with CLN5, including
  Freddie and Louie.",215,of £100k goal,https://fundrazr.com/611LCf,Battle Batten with us,13,,Pound Sterling
"On Sunday, September 24th Team Ride to Give and Team Boom will be participating in Ironman 70.3 Augusta in Augusta , GA (Athlete list with race numbers to follow) Erik and Patty Heine of Oklahoma City, OK were excited to welcome
  their first child, a son Stephen, in 2007. After he was born, the
  Heines observed Stephen had broad thumbs and toes, which they found
  odd but endearing. He also had a LOT of hair! From birth, Stephen
  struggled with feeding which caused him to have trouble gaining
  weight. It was frustrating, but they chalked it up to reflux and enjoy
  their sweet new baby. As he grew, Stephen hit his milestones on time, but always at the
  late end of the ""normal"" range. When Stephen was nine months
  old, he had hernia surgery, which led to the discovery of a heart
  murmur and a kidney abnormality. Following surgery, Stephen's physical
  development stalled, and at one year old, he was referred for Early
  Intervention for therapies. There were still lingering
    questions about his health issues, and after additional testing,
    Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome in
    May of 2008. Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome , a
  genetic disorder which affects approximately 1:250,000 births, is
  characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual
  disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first
  toes. Additional features of the disorder can include eye
  abnormalities, heart and kidney defects, dental problems, and obesity.
  These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals. People with
  this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and
  cancerous tumors, including certain kinds of brain tumors. Cancer of
  blood-forming tissue (leukemia) also occurs more frequently in people
  with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Infants born with this severe form of
  the disorder usually survive only into early childhood. Thankfully Stephen’s overall health has balanced out, and he
    is a happy and thriving 4th grader. Currently, Stephen receives private physical and occupational
  therapies, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy in
  his school setting.  To meet his goals of independence as an adult,
  Stephen spends approximately 3/4 of his school day with his typically
  developing peers, in the regular education classroom. Also, he has
  difficulty communicating verbally, so he uses Proloquo2Go software on an iPad
  mini to communicate. Doctors have not given the Heines a timeline as to what they should
  expect with Stephen, so they take everything one day at a time.
  They're determined to not let their child's disability or illness keep
  them from doing the things they love and find a way to adapt and make
  that activity possible. Erik is an avid runner, and for years it has
  been an activity he can share with Stephen. Up until recently, they
  have been able to use a traditional running stroller which Stephen has
  now out grown and is not 100% safe for him. After much research, Eric
  found the Blade at www.hoytrunningchairs.com . Hoyt Running Chairs designs and
    manufactures state-of-the-art racing chairs for individuals with
    disabilities. As a subdivision of Southbridge Tool &
    Manufacturing , they are able to custom build each chair to the
    comfort and needs of both the rider and the runner. They pride
    themselves on getting to know their clients and providing them with
    the ultimate racing experience. Mike Didonato , the president of Southbridge
    Tool & Manufacturing first heard the story of Rick and Dick Hoyt in 2009. Dick Hoyt has pushed his son Rick,
      who was diagnosed a spastic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy after
      his birth in 1962, in over 1,000 races including marathons,
      triathlons, and 6 Ironman races. Their story inspired Mike,
    and a few months later he happened to meet Dick Hoyt at a local
    grocery store. Mike mentioned his family’s manufacturing company and
    offered to fix Rick’s chair if needed. The next year, Dick Hoyt
    showed up at Southbridge Tool and Manufacturing and asked if a brand
    new chair could be built for Rick because he was very uncomfortable
    in his original chair. The Signature was built in time for the Hoyts to compete in the 2010 Boston Marathon . The chair was
    beautifully built for comfort, speed, and maneuverability. Soon,
    other teams and families began asking for a chair. In 2014, Mike was
    approached by Nick Sotar , a retired bicycle shop owner, who
    admired The Signature but had some ideas to improve the design. Nick
    presented Mike with a design for a revolutionary new racing chair
    called The Blade , which is easily
    disassembled and can be shipped in a bike box. After Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome at 18
  months old, it took almost seven years before they were able to get
  him on non-income-based Medicaid. As a result, the Heines ate through
  their entire family savings paying for medical bills and therapies
  even with insurance. Unfortunately, the cost of a Blade racing
    wheelchair is approximately 10% of Erik’s gross annual
  salary as a Professor of Music at Oklahoma City University ,
  and not something they have sitting around or in a savings account.
  The Blade has not been deemed ""essential"" by their
  insurance. However, Stephen's Occupational and Physical Therapists
  both believe that a chair that he can use for over a decade IS
  essential to helping him relieve stress and participate in an outdoor
  activity like his typically-developing peers. Ride to Give agrees and wants to provide Stephen with a custom
    built Blade that will fit him perfectly and will be used for years
    to come. Our mission at RTG is to turn athletic ability into
  fundraising power for families with children who are disabled,
  injured, or ill.  We think Stephen and Erik will make fantastic
  ambassadors for Team Ride to Give and we can’t wait to see them race
  for the first time with their new Hoyt Running Chair . Please help us purchase the
  Blade running chair and accessories for Stephen by making a tax
  deductible donation to Ride to Give. At this time, Stephen does not have a Facebook Page of his
    own, so follow Ride to GIve on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the
      donee organization (Ride to Give, 501c3 tax ID 46-2952297) has complete discretion and control over the use of all donated funds.

  within it has been Jaspers fight for life. Each day of the first 3
  weeks had presented numerous challenges both large and small and he
  has shown thus far that he is meeting them. He is now physically stable. Jasper suffered a major seizure the evening of 2/12/16. The
  severity of which has left him with anoxic brain injury (this is
  similar to a stroke). The complexity of this condition and the
  complete unknown aspect of what lies ahead in terms of recovery is
  what is being faced at this time. Jasper has weathered the
  'neurological storms' that came upon him as a result of this injury.
  These were very severe and difficult to bear. Doctors stated that
  these ""storms"" could last days, weeks, years or never cease.
  The absolutely wonderful news is his neurological storms have subsided
  after less than a month and he has been slowly awakening from this state. He has begun to move both legs, move his eyes ( visual
  tracking) and to turn his head. Very positive steps forward. He
  responds to touch and stimuli and a few times- though not yet
  consistent-we saw a smile......it was beautiful to see! Julianne, Jasper's mom (03/29/16) What we do know is that his recovery is going to be a long
  road. He is facing years of rehabilitation, initially in a
  facility equipped to deal with rebuilding his physical  and cognitive

    increase in complexity without being able to see the same range of
    color. Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
    vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
    glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color accuracy. I hope someday insurance coverage for these glasses is an option.

  remove the tumors whenever needed to preserve my life. In November 2017, I need to under go surgery again to remove multiple
  large tumors called schwannoma from both my arms. They have made my
  fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms. I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I loose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at

"“Life has a way of taking you on unexpected twists and turns that you
  did not plan or could ever imagine. So is the case with me being
  diagnosed with Sarcoidosis with advanced Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  in 2013. A disease that until then I had never heard about. Two years,
  blood tests, numerous x-rays, an open lung biopsy, CT scans, lots of
  visits to the specialist and all kinds of medications later, reality
  finds me practically house-bound on oxygen therapy learning to adjust
  to my new normal.” -Excerpt from Rosemarie Hartnick’s Blog, https://rosemariehartnick.wordpress.com Rosemarie Hartnick is a mother of two stunning boys, Ross and Connor,
  and wife to Pastor Brian Hartnick. Anyone who knows her can attest to
  the driven, selfless, motivating person that she is. Living with
  Pulmonary fibrosis for the past 4 years has taken its toll on her
  family but she refuses to become a victim of her circumstance Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease marked by scarring of the tissue
  inside and between the air sacs in the lungs. When the scar forms, the
  tissue becomes stiff and thicker. This makes it harder for oxygen to
  pass through the walls of the air sac into the bloodstream. Once the
  lung tissue becomes scarred, the damage cannot be reversed. There is
  no cure. Many people with the disease live only about three to five
  years after diagnosis. As a friend and mentee of Rosmarie Hartnick, I am, with a few of my
  friends and family looking to help in any way that I can. The family
  is in need of a portable oxygen machine, a wheelchair, and help with
  month on month medical expenses. Rosemarie has recently undergone some
  rigorous testing at the Groote Schuur Hospital where she may undergo
  the very first double lung transplant to be carried out at the facility. Through a benefit concert, taking place on 1st October 2017,  and
  other efforts, we are looking to raise R50,000 for the Hartnick Family. We need your help to accomplish this. Would you consider donating in

"Drew Aufderheide was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago with a rare and
  incurable form of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) .  Only 5,000 per
  year in the United States are diagnosed with this disease and because
  the cancer is caused by a chromosomal change, there is no way to cure
  it - only medication to keep it at bay.  At the age of 33, it is
  extremely rare for someone like Drew to have this form of leukemia. 
  It is normally diagnosed in people with an average age of 67, and the
  life expectancy is approximately 15 years. There are currently a lot
  of unknown facts surrounding Drew's case because physicians and
  oncologists do not often see CML in someone so young and because of
  Drew's young age, his life expectancy is unknown. What is known, is that Drew needs to take a maintenance chemo
  drug/pill each day to manage the CML for the rest of his life, or
  until a cure is discovered.  There are only a few drugs available at
  this time to treat this disease and Drew's body has already rejected
  3.  He is on the last and 4th drug that is available at this time and
  because it is so rare the demand for the drug is low.  The medication
  he is on now comes from Switzerland, the only place it is made.  The
  doctor orders it through a lab in New Jersey, it is then
  mailed directly to Drew. This medication is not available through a pharmacy. Because of the low demand, the cost for Drew's medication is
  approximately $11,000 per/month.  Medical Insurance and grants pay a
  portion of the entire cost of the drug, so Drew is faced with finding
  funding to make up the balance.  This disease has been an incredible
  financial strain on Drew and his wife Val, who have been married for
  four years. With this medication comes side effects that he must
  manage.  Drew has met this challenge with his usual strength of
  determination, peace of soul, his faith in God and warm and loving demeanor. Drew is very grateful for the prayers and financial support people
  have shown him in the past.  Financially, the importance of any
  monetary gifts cannot be overstated.  It has allowed him to pay for
  the medication to keep him alive.  From a faith viewpoint, he cannot
  thank you all enough for your prayers.  He knows from experience that
  prayer works.  During this last year when weeks of side effects have
  kept him in bed unable to work, he felt your love and prayers.","13,565",of $20k goal,https://fundrazr.com/exjqd,Drew’s leukemia fight,133,,U.S. Dollar
"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . *Notice: We are experiencing some delays with kit turnover, so
    please allow 2-3 weeks for your kit to arrive.* Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"DID YOU KNOW? Donny has red/green color deficiency o r
          ""colorblindness"" So while he can see most color he
          struggles to see certain colors or certain colors look
          different to him than to you and I. It's difficult to say if
          he even sees ""real"" colors the way we do. We play
          the ""what color is this?"" game a lot. -Sometimes Don can't
          differentiate between Guacamole and Bean dip without having to
          taste it since sometimes they are the same color to him. -He gave his sister food
          poisoning once because he couldn't tell that the chicken he
          cooked was still pink. (pink tends to look grey to him) -Speaking of which, this one
          time we were playing the Slug Bug game and this light blue beetle was driving by and he
          yelled ""PINK SLUG BUG"" before punching me- he
          cheated and we haven't played that game since. -He has to change the color
          options in his video games. Bad guys = red, team
          members=green, yeah... he can't tell most of the time so he
          ends up losing a lot because he doesn't shoot the bad guy or
          he shoots his own team member. (it's actually pretty cute when
          he plays with his little brother. The little brother sometimes
          coaches him ""Shoot!"" ""Don't shoot!"")
          You'll be surprised how many video games don't give color
          alternatives for red/green -Certain shades of Purple =
          Blue or vice versa in his world. I don't think he could see
          our wedding colors properly. I'm pretty sure he agreed to the
          color because I liked it and didn't want to disappoint me. -I've caught him asking little
          kids what colors were. Not because that's an adult thing to do
          but because he truly doesn't know . -When we shop he usually asks
          me ""what color are these?"" I've rescued him many
          times from buying the worst poop-colored pants. So. Many. Times. There's a ton more stories
          about Don and his color deficiency but it's part of our daily

"Hi There! We’re a family of four that are in great need of support to help
    our youngest member Justin, recover from Lyme’s Disease, as well as
    rehab off of addictive Schizophrenic medication. In short, he was bitten by a deer tick on an eco-estate, which
    had imported deer from Germany, and he came down with all the
    symptoms of Lyme’s Disease. In South Africa where we stay, there are
    no facilities to test for Lyme’s Disease and doctors automatically
    rule that out as a diagnosis, because it’s widely believed that one
    can’t contract it here. Instead, they misdiagnosed Justin with
    Schizophrenia and placed him on a treatment that seems to have
    caused even more neurological damage in the years to follow. One of the main problems that Justin has is severe insomnia,
    which seems to have gotten way worse since he’s been on the
    anti-psychotic medication. Some of the latest research on insomnia
    suggests that the brain begins to “eat itself” after extended
    periods of sleep deprivation, which we can relate to – sometimes
    Justin is no different to someone with Alzheimer’s Disease or
    Dementia. When Justin sleeps however, the majority of his symptoms
    rapidly improves and we strongly believe with your help that we can
    find a way to reverse his condition! The Plan While spending many hours looking for ways to solve this

    an expert in dealing with cases like Justin’s. Dr Klinghardt
      is an expert in neurology and devising holistic treatment

    will be able to accurately diagnose and treat Justin. In addition,
    we also have found various medical centers that test genetics
    (unlike in South Africa) so that we may get an exact understanding
    of Justin’s condition. We need funds to fly to the US to receive proper diagnosis and
  treatment . We need a total of $50K to cover our basic costs
  (it may cost more depending on what the doctor says). We will need to
  stay overseas for up to six months and this funding will cover
  airfares, modest accommodation, diagnostic tests and Justin’s
  treatment for six months. We believe that Dr Klinghardt, in combination with genetic profiling
  will get to the root of the problem. You can find out more info about
  him here: http://drklinghardt.com/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKx_TMPQJsY The Full Story Every day that passes we watch Justin slip further away both
    physically and mentally … Some days are better than others … He
    suffers so much in his confused exhaustion that it’s hard to witness
    and difficult to live with. We honestly don’t know how he manages to
    continue, and so bravely, when his nightmare never seems to end. Justin’s problems began after he was misdiagnosed with
      Schizophrenia almost 4 years ago following a tick bite. The eco-estate we lived on at that time, had a private game
    reserve that included imported deer from Europe, amongst a variety
    of other game. Justin contracted his bite whilst being taken for a
    walk by our two huskies in the game park. He lost his balance and
    was dragged along for a short way. Two days later, mom spotted a
    tick on his leg and removed it. She noticed that it was unlike any
    of the species we normally see in South Africa. After searching for
    ticks on google images, we saw that it was identical to ticks that
    are found on deer in Europe and in the US; and that they are the
    ones that give people a disease called Lyme’s disease. In
      South Africa, there is no test for Lyme’s Disease, since
    it is widely believed that we don’t have ticks that transmit this
    disease in our country. In the year before, our dad died suddenly when he was
      hit by a car as he was crossing a street. We had no
    choice but to use the local government hospital to treat Justin’s
    condition, as we couldn’t afford private health care. The hospital
    staff dismissed our fears of Lyme’s disease from the start, and
    because he had been depressed and suffered from insomnia after dad’s
    death, they concluded that Justin had Schizophrenia. Initially, the
    anti-psychotic meds and benzodiazepines showed a modest improvement,
    but Justin became severely sleep deprived and was unable to sleep
    deeply or experience life normally. After a few months, a family friend donated funds so that we
    could treat Justin privately. He was taken off the hospital
    medications and slowly started to recover with a natural holistic
    program. He made steady progress in this
    time. Although he was not the same person as before, he was
    at least able to play the piano again and integrate back into being
    a part of the family. During this time, mom stopped working and his
    older brother moved back home to help us (sister and mom) care for
    him, as well as put food on the table. The medical expenses were
    exorbitant and after a year we could no longer continue with private treatment. By the end of 2015, two years after Justin’s initial tick bite, he was bitten a second time , but this time it was
    by one of our local ticks. It's usually fairly easy to recover from
    an acute bout of tick bite fever from these ticks, but in Justin’s
    case the whole nightmare we thought was behind us began all over
    again … We had to rush him intohospital and this
    time he was put on even stronger anti-psychotic medication. The
    doctors we saw (a different one every time) believed that he had
    relapsed because we had taken him off the previous prescription
    of anti-psychotic meds. In spite of the latest medication, Justin has not recovered
    since and in the last 18 months he has deteriorated rapidly. He has
    lost over 24 kilograms in the last 7 months. He sleeps a few hours
    every 4 -5 nights. He has dream states and rapid eye movements in
    mid sentence and his memory is not functional. He has become very
    childlike and needs constant supervision and input. Since
      being on the benzodiazepine medicine, he has also developed
      obsessive behaviors , like having the same conversations
    over and over, bingeing on food or pacing in continuous loops
    through the house. He is very stressed and unable to relate to
    people or even our animals, although he adored them before and used
    to spend the most time with them. The medications have not worked and we believe that they are
      making his condition worse - he has become a hollow shell of his former beautiful self.
    The hospital’s staff says that there is nothing we can do; except
    put him on even stronger medications and put him into a government
    institution. The place they recommend has a ghastly reputation and
    is like a prison for the insane - it's like giving him a living
    death sentence. Our family feels that this is outrageous – it is not
    a solution and we cannot agree to just give up on Justin, especially
    after we have already seen him nearly recovered the first time!
    Justin needs expert help that is not available in our
    under-resourced public health system. After reviewing all the
    research we could find, we believe that we need to take him
      overseas to the US to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",105,of $50k goal,https://fundrazr.com/41GoD5,Justin's Journey,3,"Nov 13, 2017",U.S. Dollar
"OUR GAME PLAN We are looking into effective alternative treatments to try to
    save Mom's life. She needs cancer-killing herbs, roots, oils, a raw
    foods diet, and we might even consider a trip to the States to a
    cancer clinic that has had a high success rate in treating people
    with cancer, plus we’re trying to get her moved back to B.C. so she can be
    near to family during this difficult time. The costs she faces are considerable, and unfortunately,
    alternative treatments aren’t recognized or covered under most
    health plans, and standard treatments also entail costs, both of
    which are looming on the horizon. Mom has grappled with health problems for years and suffers with
    pain each day, and yet in spite of this, she has reached out to help
    others heal emotionally. I’m praying that in her time of need, her friends and
    acquaintances will come to her aid. This would pave the way for her to get the treatments she needs
    to win this terrible battle she faces. ABOUT MY MOM From an early age, Mom shared a deep bond with animals. She
    traveled to the tropics and was captivated by the parrots there. In
    later years, she worked with abused parrots and rehabilitated them,
    teaching them to trust and love again. My mom has always been deeply touched by music and she is a
    talented guitarist and plays the piano. One of her favorite piano
    pieces is Clair de Lune by Debussy. She’s also an author and needs more time to finish and publish
    the books she was working on before she fell ill. She is my mother and a loving grandmother and we don't want her
    life cut short, nor have her torn away from us. One of her greatest
    wishes is to have more years to spend with us. LET’S HELP MAKE HER WISHES COME TRUE If you decide to donate to this fundraiser, any gift, whether
    large or small, will be deeply appreciated, and we thank you from
    the bottom of our hearts. Your actions may make a huge difference to
    Mom’s life and to all those who care about her and who don’t want to
    lose her.","1,450",of $20k goal,https://fundrazr.com/41FO1c,PLEASE HELP SAVE MY MOM,11,,Canadian Dollar

"Do you know Michelle, like I know Michelle? I first met Michelle
  almost 8 years ago when we were taking a course together. We became
  fast friends as we shared a love of family, food and life. Her
  positive and caring spirit along with her amazing sense of humor have
  always inspired me. She has made a career as an incredibly talented
  Stylist and has shared her passion with a great many colleagues and
  students over the past 23 years. Just over a year ago, upon returning home from a business trip to
  California, Michelle started experiencing minor symptoms of not
  feeling well and knew that something was off. There is no way any of
  us could have predicted what would follow. It turned out that Michelle
  was in Congestive Heart Failure and was taken by Air Ambulance out of
  Williams Lake so that further diagnostic tests could be performed. Her
  husband Jamie was working out in the middle of the Chilcoltin and it
  was uncertain if we would be able to contact him. By the efforts of an
  amazing friend, he was reached and given the shocking news that his
  wife was in Cardiac Failure. The results of these early test had her
  referred to much more specialized Doctors in Vancouver at St. Paul's
  Hospital. She was admitted to hospital to undergo more specialized and
  invasive tests and underwent surgery to implant a Cardiac
  Defibrillator. Immediately prior to discharge Michelle was informed
  that she would need to have a Heart Transplant and that she would need
  to be on a regimen of extensive medications and dietary restrictions
  to stabilize her heart while we waited for transplant. This was
  shocking news to say the least. Michelle had been tested from an early
  age on a regular basis because a heart condition ran in her family.
  Her older brother died of a sudden cardiac event at age 15 in 1982 and
  her Father in January of 1990. No cardiac symptoms presented in
  Michelle and by age 32 she figured that she didn't have the genetic
  defect, and like so many others, found herself without a Family
  Physician so did not undergo further cardiac testing for over a decade. Michelle has not been able to work since May of 2016 and has had to
  travel to Vancouver from Williams Lake several times over the last
  year to see the team of Transplant Doctors. With becoming a single
  income household, she is anxious as to how to pay for the upcoming
  expenses that will be incurred for Transplant, a burden she does not
  want to leave to her Husband, Jamie, to figure out. Recently Michelle and Jamie were evacuated from their home due to the
  wildfires surrounding their hometown here in BC. They spent 3 weeks
  away from home and it was while they were evacuated that Michelle got
  the news that she is now ""active"" on the Transplant list.
  This means that BC Transplant is actively looking for a Donor Heart
  match for her and that they could get the call at anytime. Michelle will have to remain in Vancouver post-surgery in order to be
  monitored for symptoms of rejection and infection. She will not be
  able to be on her own in the weeks and months immediately following
  surgery and it is anticipated that she will have to remain in
  Vancouver for up to 12 months to participate in the rehabilitation process. I have always known Michelle to be kind and thoughtful and usually is
  happiest helping others or feeding people. She has a joyful and
  generous spirit and is beloved by many but especially friends and
  family. Will you help Michelle and Jamie and alleviate the pressure of
  this monumental journey they are about to go through? Even the
  smallest donation will help. Please donate today and help this very
  special person not have to worry and be focused on her recovery.","2,290",of $30k goal,https://fundrazr.com/newheartformichelle,Please help us fund Michelle's Heart Transplant,24,"Jul 1, 2018",Canadian Dollar
"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.","1,442",of $500k goal,https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1,Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,20,,U.S. Dollar

    14. He had a great work ethic and worked not only his full time job
    but side jobs. He was a mechanic and painter a nd
    his main career was for 30+years as a Manager and District Manager
    in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to
    pay for his rides to therapy, Doctors visits etc. Our medical bills are mounting and there has been no place to
    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the
    numerous supplements that he has to take. If all bills get paid with

  struggle for Black Liberation. Seth was sentenced to 25 years to life, which means after

  Seth has a large and loving family and supportive community who yearn

  chronic medical problems. We are waging a campaign for Seth concerning his ailing health.
  With proper medical care, Seth's health issues could be under control
  but the horribly inadequate health care during his incarceration
  places him at grave risk. The combination of repetitive parole denials
  and neglectful medical care equates to a extrajudicial death sentence
  for Seth. In addition struggling to receive medical care, Seth is also
  fighting for his constitutional rights at the parole board. Seth is a
  model prisoner and meets all criteria for release, yet has been
  repetitively denied parole for no other reason than ""the serious
  nature of the original crime."" This essentially means that the
  Parole Board is taking it upon themselves to re-sentence Seth to life

And, if you haven’t heard already, please visit my website at https://peanutbutterandcancer.com/ for the full shebang. For those of you that may not be able to visit the website... Here’s the skinny. I have brain cancer. I know what you’re feeling, shock, me too
    when I first found out. It started when I was in North Carolina visiting my mom who was
    having a benign brain tumor removed on October 18th. (She’s
    recovering great.) While there, I began having some difficulty
    reading, super aggressive vomiting, and ultimately a raging
    headache. This lasted for a couple of days. My Nanny fortuitously
    took me to the ER in our hometown to, at the very least, get some
    fluids. During that visit, the docs did a CT scan which showed
    evidence of pressure on my brain and the team recommended further
    testing. So I flew back to Denver, CO on October 23. Noah (my
    husband) and I went to Porter ER for follow up. An MRI revealed a
    mass in my brain and they suggested immediate surgery. On 10/25 I
    underwent a successful surgery to remove the visible portions of the
    25mm mass and the tissue was sent out for testing. I was released
    from the hospital on 10/28. On November 1st, I found
    out I have the deadliest of all 120 types of brain tumors, Stage 4
    Glioblastoma (GBM). And... about 3 weeks ago we received some exciting news.  I tested
  positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV).  Which means the CVM is
    found in 60% of all GBMs.  It's also found in the stem cells of all
    GBMs.  This gives us reason to think the cause of the cancer could
    be from a virus. Which we are currently treating with antiviral
    medications. So, in a world of medicine that's not quite sure what
    to do with GBMs, this gives us a place to start. So, we got some fighting to do, huh? Here’s what treatment looks like. First I radically changed my diet (bye bye sugar and peanut butter) Then we started taking every supplement under the sun that is
    rumored to have anti-cancer properties. After consulting our naturopathic oncologist and nutritionist,
    we've narrowed down what supplements work for me.  Luckily, I've
    been able to take less pills. Yay! We've done the radiation and the first round of chemo. I'll
    still be doing small doses of chemo for the next 6 months. I’ve also been doing a number of alternative and spiritual
    treatments: sound bath, reiki, acupuncture Soon I’ll be starting Optune. (This is the part where I shave my
  head). You can check it out here if you want more info ... https://www.optune.com/ This is what I'll look like with the Optune on What I need from you. Send positive vibes. If you believe in Quantum Physics, you know
    energy can heal. Forward any contacts or resources you may have surrounding
    successful GBM treatments. Consider a monetary donation. Unfortunately, stupid cancer isn't
    cheap. GBM is like a needy, expensive house guest that doesn't know
    when to leave. If you feel compelled to donate, we appreciate your contribution.",https://fundrazr.com/pbandcancer
"3,000",Help Rachel overcome her immune disorder,U.S. Dollar,,of $4.3k goal,10,"Hello!  My name is Rachel from Michigan.  I am first of all a child
  of King Jesus, and also the wife of an amazing man, and mother of five
  precious children, ages 1-14. When we moved to Michigan, I am thankful I did not know what was in
  store.  I had always been healthy and took care of myself but after
  giving birth to our youngest daughter in 2011, I began to feel
  strange, spreading symptoms in my body. At first I thought it would go away, ""The fatigue was just post
  childbirth, the burning pain might be a simple yeast infection, or
  maybe if I improved my diet?"" I thought. Well, fast-forward eight years and I have seen over 40 doctors, tried
  many treatments, and spent tens of thousands of dollars.  Some issues
  have improved.  Although I may look fine on the outside, inside of me
  still has pain all the time. I am looking for your help with a treatment called Lymestop.  I plan
  to go to Wisconsin in December for six days. Dr. Ben Erlandson, who
  recovered his own health, uses a protocol he learned from a doctor in
  Idaho.  There is about an eighty-five percent success rate. My husband asked if I could set up a fundraising website to help with
  the costs.  We are about maxed out financially with building a home to
  replace our manufactured house we suspected was not healthy for me,
  given my susceptibilty to mold.  We know many have given generously in
  the past, and we are grateful.  There are no guarantees in my journey,
  except Jesus' promises to be with us. Specifically, I would like to raise $4300 by Dec. 4.  The clinic
  costs $3300 for treatments including supplements for 3 months and a
  followup visit.  I also am including gas and food in the total
  amount.  I plan for my family to also come in a separate vehicle and
  the doctor will test them.  Then they will return to Michigan while I
  am treated. I am applying to substitute teach this fall and have been picking and
  selling blueberries so I can help contribute to my costs, too. Primarily, I am asking on behalf of my family.  Although they can
  live with a mommy who is often struggling through pain, fighting
  irritability and impatience, I want more for them.  I long to be
  engaged, energetic, and joyful.  In the event that God brings physical
  healing, I might fulfill my roles as a wife and mommy with all my
  heart, soul, mind and strength. Thankyou for your help.",https://fundrazr.com/c1YSf2
"58,912",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,909,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes

    observing UC San Diego's holiday break from December 19th, 2019, until January 5th , 2020. Therefore, processing time for kit
  orders may change. Delays may also be seen for international orders. As our labs will be closed during this time, we recommend
    sending samples in by December 19th. Samples sent during the break
    will be held up in the mail, which can lead to sample quality degradation. Return ground shipping with our provided pre-paid labels
      typically takes 4-5 business days , so please plan accordingly. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The American Gut Project is a part of the Microsetta Initiative , with the mission of
    collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data from
    populations across the globe. The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects
    worldwide have laid an important foundation for understanding the
    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 If You Live in the U.S.: Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if
    you would like to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed
    as a perk, email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go
      out. If you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit
      will not be sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere Else: International participants are also welcome to join. An
    additional $25 international shipping fee also
    applies (which you would add as an additional contribution
  after claiming a perk), along with other regulations . I f you
    do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be sent out
    until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in
  the U.S. from some locations can be expensive , so it is
    recommended that you look into the cost of return shipping (it is
    highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3-4 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It takes significantly longer (6+ months)
      to receive results if you submit one of the following sample
      types: Oral or skin samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome . Note that your de-identified information will be part of a

"3,863",Calling All Angels! Help Lua cover costs of cancer therapies.,U.S. Dollar,,of $18k goal,27,"As a healer who has studied, embraced, and recommended alternative
  and complimentary therapies for nearly fifty years (and eaten a mostly
  organic, whole food diet for the last 25 years), to hear the doctor
  say I have an incurable form of breast cancer is a shock to the
  system.  This is a story of the wisdom and energy that animates our
  bodies, which is both our life force and our deepest knowing, and how
  hope and healing manifest through prayer and intention. It started Memorial Day weekend - 14 hours of strenuous yard work
  over three days to uproot the prolific nut grass that was choking the
  decorative and floral plants in both the front and back yard.  I'd
  gone back to my yoga practice in earnest - the air in Sacramento was
  making me wheeze for about 20 minutes after my high intensity cycling
  classes, so I joined the karma crew at Arden Hot Yoga and was feeling
  like I'd never been stronger in my life and as I approached my 60th
  birthday I had regained much of my flexibility.  But the yard work -
  digging and pulling for hours on end - landed right around T-12
  (bottom of rib cage on the spine) and all of my usual methods for
  realigning the spine weren't working. After a chiro fractured my third rib just underneath the L shoulder
  blade, I swore I would never go to a chiro again (2017).  But my
  family of body workers and light workers were unable to release the
  restriction in my back, so I started searching for a chiro with good
  reviews and methods for releasing the musculature both prior to and
  after adjusting the spine.  I booked an appointment and the first
  visit was fine.  I informed him of my prior injury, informed him that
  I had osteopenia ( the bones are weaker than normal, but not so far gone that
      they break easily, which is the hallmark of
  osteoporosis ).  Consequently, he opted to adjust the mid
  thoracic spine with me lying supine (face up), a lower impact
  approach.  The second adjustment felt intense, but not like anything
  was cracked. But in the morning, as I started to take a breath in, my
  ribcage TOTALLY seized up, giving me about 30% normal lung capacity. I went to an Osteopathic Manual Therapist who is AMAZING, and he
  released the diaphragm so that I could once again breathe ($95 for a
  15-minute session).  I called my tribe of fellow healers and they all
  got busy putting my displaced ribs back in place and relieving the
  muscle spasms in the intercostals (little muscles in between the ribs)
  and my L hip flexors.  After three weeks, there was little
  improvement, but for my breathing.  In fact, the pain was getting
  worse and migrating all over the ribs, the shoulders and into my
  hands, down to the left leg and turning into plantarfasciitis.  I was
  worried that the Rheumatoid Arthritis (that had been reversed with the
  addition of a few supplements to my regimen) was returning,  and I
  ordered a 12-week supply of cerasomal cis-9 cetyl myristoleate (CMO),
  a fatty acid chain that had completely reversed the chronic RA pain
  that had been slowly crippling me from 2007 through 2010.  A few
  sessions with a Bowen Therapist had brought about a 40% reduction in
  my pain and kicked my lymphatic system into gear.  Daily kelp and CMO
  had me pain free within a span of twelve weeks. My rheumatologist
  changed my diagnosis from RA to ""elevated rheumatoid factor""
  in August of 2016. By late June 2019, I phoned my primary care office.  My doc was out
  on maternity leave until January 2020, so I was seen by my son's
  primary doc.  I requested an x-ray, and the doctor felt it was
  unnecessary. l prevailed, explaining that I wanted data, and that if
  there was a fracture I would suspend my attempts at yoga and rest
  until it healed, but that if there was no fracture, I would continue
  with slow-motion asanas and avoid anything that provoked pain or
  discomfort.  The x-ray was unremarkable. I continued with gentle stretching, but was becoming less and less
  mobile over the next month and by mid-August I had a feeling that
  something was VERY WRONG.  I went back to the condescending Dr.
  ""I don't like diagnostic tools, because they necessitate more
  diagnostics"" and requested an MRI.  He indicated that he didn't
  like MRIs, because all kinds of asymptomatic things show up that you
  have to chase down with more tests.  I indicated that it just sounded
  like lazy medicine to me, that my insurance would cover the test (I'd
  had one with the prior chiropractic injury), that it was my right to
  request it, and his obligation to order it, which he did.  The online
  platform for communication with my entire medical team (PCP, Ob/Gyn,
  rheumatologist, endocrinologist, etc.) provided a copy of the referral
  instructing me to contact a certain phone number if I hadn't received
  a call to schedule the MRI within ten business days.  I waited the
  requisite number of days and phoned the imaging center to schedule the
  MRI, which was set for August 27. In the meanwhile, I also called the insurance company and changed my
  Primary Care Physician to an osteopath who went to medical school at
  Touro University, which I knew trained their docs intensively in Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (the origin and foundation for CranioSacral Therapy), and was hopeful
  that perhaps Sutter Medical might offer OMT - an uncommon practice in
  mainstream healthcare.  I booked my first appointment (meet and greet)
  with the new PCP, whom I will refer to as Dr Yes. On September 11, I arrived at the physical therapy office for my
  first appointment to assess the pain, swelling, and weakness in my
  hands and feet, which I believed to be referred from the spastic L hip
  flexor and nerve impingement in the cervical spine.  I paid the co-pay
  and waited to be called in.  The PT attending me that day informed me
  that we were not going to be having a session that day, that they
  would refund the $15 co-pay, and that I should proceed upstairs to the
  family practice (Let's call him Dr. No), because the MRI results and
  report would be reviewed with the doctor who ordered the tests. The
  doctor's tone and demeanor were vastly different that day, a mixture
  of penitence and slow deliberation with no trace of his usual
  dismissive and patronizing superiority. Dr. No explained that the MRI not only indicated a fractured
    seventh rib at the right flank , but also revealed multiple
  lesions on my axial and appendicular skeleton (ribs, spine, iliac
  crest, and right shoulder, and pelvis), specifically ""osseous
  structures suspicious for diffuse osseous metastatic disease"" or
  BONE CANCER.  He referred me to the medical oncology department, and
  ordered for the next day a PET-scan from the base of the skull to
  mid-thigh with contrast dye. Dr. No said he would be happy to continue
  as my primary care doc until my doctor returned from maternity leave
  in January, and sent me on my way.  I was reeling, certain that the
  fact it had metastasized to the bone meant that there was no treatment
  - I was a goner (this was the last metastatic phase of both my
  brother's and my mother's cancer battle). On 9/13 (Friday the 13th), I saw that the report was in from the
  PET-scan, but knew that they would wait to provide the report to me
  until the oncology team met with me.  I couldn't get through an entire
  weekend knowing the results were in but that I'd be left in the dark
  for a few days.  So I staked out a chair in the waiting area at my new
  Osteopath’s office and, when called up, requested a copy of the
  PET-scan report, which I could get help interpreting to some degree -
  enough not to freak myself out reading it unsupervised.  An hour
  later, I'd spent five minutes with the attending physician and left
  with the report in hand.  It showed many lesions in the axial (spine
  and ribs) and appendicular (pelvis, sternum, manubrium, shoulder)
  skeleton, and lesions in all four quadrants of the right breast,
  suggesting breast cancer and metastatic bone disease (cancer spreading
  from the breast), but nothing in the left breast and all clear in the
  organs and soft tissue. A referral was made to oncology, and my sister Lisa and I met with
  the oncologist the following week.  She ordered a breast MRI and we
  met with her the following week to review the results - again imaging
  suggesting cancer in the right breast.  A biopsy was ordered for the
  following Friday.  It felt like an eternity between these
  appointments, and the pain in my bones worsened by the day,
  necessitating a walker and fairly powerful opioids to quell the deep
  bone pain.  The oncologist drafted a letter to my employer (State of
  California) recommending that I be approved for teleworking (from home
  in my pjs) due to the weakness of the bones and risk of falling.  This
  was quickly approved, and my employer has been mercifully flexible and
  accommodating with my schedule so that I can preserve my sick and
  vacation leave and still put the hours in to do my job. Once we got
  the pain management figured out, I found a balance between pain relief
  and mental acuity for focus on the detailed research and work I do. The biopsy/ultrasound/mammogram results came back, and we met with
  the breast oncologist on October 7th.  He confirmed that I have a
  highly aggressive and fast spreading form of cancer known
    as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER-2 positive ). I'm undergoing
    a 12-week round of chemo therapy through December 21 (at which time
    they will repeat the PET-Scan to see what the treatments have
    achieved), as well as a full year of infusion with HER2 -targeted therapies (Trastuzumab or Herceptin).
    I have just completed a week of radiation treatments on the
    metastasis in the left hip socket, which was growing excruciatingly
    painful, and the pain is already down to about a '3' on a scale of
    one to ten, as opposed to last week's pain level, which was '20.'
    Monthly injections of a bone strengthening agent to rebuild the bone
    that was digested by cancerous lesions already seem to be working
    and my posture is gradually improving. They tell me that this cancer
    is incurable and will require close monitoring and ongoing
    treatments when it does recur, and that, if all goes well, I may have another five years to live. But I’ve declared a Jihad on Cancer, and am determined, God
    willing, to be one those people we all know who was supposed to be
    dead 20 years ago.  I am asking for your prayers, visits if you have
    time and proximity in your favor, and am launching this campaign to
    help me cover what the insurance company does not:  copays,
    prescriptions, complementary treatments such as colonics,
    acupuncture, Chinese and Tibetan herbs, vitamins and supplements, 
    devices such as  compression socks & orthopedic shoes for
    neuropathy, and gentle body work sessions as I heal! I ’m feeling so incredibly held by the Divine Loving Force that
    animates every last atom of our existence and buoyed up by the
    outpouring of prayers and love from all of the extraordinary friends
    and family members who keep showing up to bless the way! Thankful
    that the chiro cracked a rib and drew attention to what was brewing
    under the surface. Let the healing continue!",https://fundrazr.com/CallingAllAngels

  meant to inspire and inform teenagers about preparing their own
  snacks. The 3 day workshop will be led by Beth Gates who has been
  involved with promoting cooking and teaching cooking classes to teens
  for over 8 years in the Portland area. Each day she will bring a new
  recipe for the students to make themselves: quick pickles, smoothies,
  and fancy toast. The goal is that students will have the knowledge to
  prepare snacks that are: delicious, affordable, nutritious , and are
  informed by sustainable practices (low packaging etc) Students will be
  eating the food they prepare as well as collecting recipes, and taking
  home their own pickles. They will also be given instruction on what it
  means to shop within a growing season and using seasonal fruits and
  vegetables. As sixth graders, many students are now home alone after
  school and are preparing snacks, if not meals, for themselves. I feel
  it is important to empower them to make informed choices about the
  food they eat. Last year, Beth taught a one “smoothie” making
    lesson to our 6th grade students and it was described as a highlight
    of the year by the kids. Beth Gates is part of the CookFirst Collective. The mission of
    the collective is to cultivate home cooking, cooking with
    ingredients “on-hand” or seasonably available, and to inspire risk
    taking in the kitchen. Beth has taught youth cooking classes both as
    after school programs in PPS middle schools as well as Saturday
    Academy courses through PCC. Last year Beth taught a one “smoothie”

  excitation of nervous tissue, leading to abnormal impulses along
  nerves that affect blood vessels and skin."" There are four stages
  of RSD, during which progressive changes occur in the skin, muscles,
  joints, ligaments, organs and bones of the affected area. RSD attacks
  the nervous system and eventually has crippling results. The Suicide Disease – Understanding the Stages of CRPS This
  post will cover the four different stages of Complex Regional Pain
  Syndrome (CRPS). Stage One CRPS – This stage is referred to as the Acute Stage. From
  cases around the world, doctors estimate that this stage can last
  anywhere from 30 to 100 days. Patients experience excessive pain in an
  extremity (Leg or Arm typically). This pain is described to be a
  burning, pins and needles type sensation which lasts the entire day.
  CRPS is also known as the “Suicide Disease” because it may drive
  patients to the brink of death. During stage one, patients can expect
  the skin of the affected area to become dry, thin and shiny in
  appearance as well. Stage Two CRPS – This stage is known as the Dystrophic Stage. During
  this stage of CRPS, many patients will experience dystrophy of the
  area. Because of the inadequate use of the limb, muscular dystrophy is
  common during stage two of CRPS. A patient can experience increased
  swelling and pain as well. The pain can become so severe that light
  actually makes the pain even worse. The pain is generally the same,
  but what differentiates stage one from stage two is the affected area.
  The affected area in this stage generally becomes larger. Say if the
  injury occurred in the wrist, a patient in stage two may see the pain
  spreading up the arm. Stage Three CRPS – Also known as the Atrophic Stage. Patients who
  have had CRPS for more than a year, are considered to be in stage
  three. Atrophy is when wasting begins in the organs and tissue. The
  pain will continue to be constant and hit more or less a plateau. Many
  patients also experience contracture. X-rays may reveal osteoporosis
  of the affected bone in that area. Stage Four CRPS – This is the
  most advanced stage of CRPS. Damage to a limb may be so severe that an
  amputation may be recommended by a medical professional. Although, it
  is recommended to not perform an amputation of the limb. Recent
  studies from medical professionals have suggested that amputation is
  not the most effective medical solution, that is actually results in
  more complications for the patient. Most patients who make it to stage
  four, will not recover from CRPS.",https://fundrazr.com/e1S8D0
125,O viata mai buna pentru Catalin,Euro,,of €2k goal,7,"Buna! Ma numesc Nicoleta Poganu si as dori sa
    va solicit ajutorul pentru un prieten foarte bun care are mare
    nevoie de un pat special,adaptat nevoilor lui si care i-ar
    imbunatati starea de sanatate. Acest pat are o baza reglabila astfel incat
    si-ar putea aduce corpul intr-o alta pozitie si sa respire mai
    bine,previne problemele circulatorii si aparitia escarelor. Daca am putea aduna mai multi bani,i-am face
    o surpriza si i-am lua chiar si un filtru pentru aer,pentru o
    respiratie mai buna dar,oricum,patul este prioritatea! Sa va spun cine este prietenul meu. As vrea sa va spun o poveste despre cineva
    foarte drag mie.E atat de special incat va fi greu sa nu scriu mult
    despre el.Unii prieteni sunt trimisi de Dumnezeu in vietile noastre
    iar prieteniile adevarate devin parteneriate.Cuvintele sunt
    nefolositoare atunci cand vrem sa vorbim despre cat de mult poate
    insemna cineva. Numele prietenului meu minunat despre care
    vorbesc este Catalin Danaila. Eu si Catalin locuim in Romania dar in
    zone diferite, separati de o distanta de 700 km. Ne-am intalnit pe
    un grup de facebook pentru persoane cu dizabilitati, amandoi avand o
    boala neuromusculara. Suntem uniti nu doar de probleme dar, mai mult
    de atat, de sensibilitatea si umanitatea pe care amandoi le avem.
    Avem atat de multe lucruri in comun. Dragostea si compasiunea pentru
    animale si oameni care au nevoie de ajutor sunt o parte din ele. Dar
    Catalin e mai mult. Este persoana cea mai generoasa,sensibila,
    loiala si devotata pe care am cunoscut-o vreodata. Intotdeauna vrea
    sa ajute pe toata lumea iar inima ii este sfasiata pentru fiecare
    animalut care sufera. Pas cu pas am aflat multe lucruri despre
    povestea de viata a bunului meu prieten. Catalin are 46 de ani iar diagnosticul lui e
    atrofie musculara spinala (SMA). E imobilizat in scaun rulant iar
    atrofia musculara e progresiva, degenerativa.Se lupta mult sa
    mentina boala macar in stadiul actual. Din nefericire, situatia s-a
    agravat in timp deoarece SMA afecteaza toti muschii (maini,
    picioare, plamani, respiratie). In ochii mei el e un erou!E atat de
    inteligent si plin de compasiune incat limitele fizice par a fi atat
    de nedrepte. Dar boala nu e optiunea nimanui iar o sanatate buna e
    ceea ce meritam cu totii. Pentru unii dintre noi un“strop” de
    sanatate si putina fericire sunt de ajuns, nu cerem mult. Catalin are multe nevoi dar intotdeauna a
    donat si i-a ajutat pe ceilalti. I-a ales mereu pe ceilalti inainte
    de-a se gandi la el insusi. Dar el e primul in ochii mei. Unul dintre lucrurile de care Catalin are
    mare nevoie e un pat adaptat nevoilor lui. Muschii mainilor fiindu-i
    grav afectati, nu se poate ajuta sa-si schimbe pozitia in pat, sa se
    intoarca sau sa se ridice. Trebuie sa-i dea telefon fratelui, sa-i
    ceara ajutorul pentru aceste miscari. Dar nu poate apela telefonic
    in mijlocul noptii sau cand fratele lui e la servici. Patul acesta
    ar aduce o mare schimbare in viata lui. I-ar readuce putina
    independenta, ceea ce e foarte important pentru cineva care are o dizabilitate. Imaginati-va cum ar fi sa stati intr-o
    singura pozitie, fara sa va puteti ajuta din cauza lipsei de putere
    in maini. Acest pat special e foarte util atat ziua cat si noaptea.
    Il va ajuta sa-si schimbe pozitia, sa previna escarele, sa nu faca
    presiune ramanand imobilizat intr-o singura pozitie, va preveni
    problemele circulatorii si va respira mai bine. Un somn mai bun ii
    va imbunatati starea de sanatate. Va rog ajutati-ma sa il ajut pe Catalin! De
    data aceasta are nevoie de noi! Haideti sa reusim impreuna si sa fim
    o parte dintr-o poveste de viata! Catalin merita tot ajutorul si o
    spun din toata inima. Acesta este patul de care are nevoie iar
    costul lui e de aproximativ 1800 euro, doar ca nu stiu care va fi
    taxa de curierat ce se va adauga la pret. Daca reusim sa strangem
    2000 euro si vor mai ramane bani dupa achizitionarea patului, al
    2-lea link este cu ceva de care ar avea nevoie pentru problemele de
    plamani. Oricum, as spune ca strangerea de fonduri sa fie de 2000
    euro pentru acest pat.",https://fundrazr.com/OviatamaibunapentruCatalin

"155,150",Help James McCarthy in his battle against leukemia,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,986,"How you can help: Donate to James’ care: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay Register to be a bone marrow donor: http://www.bethematch.org/ James’ Story: On Tuesday, August 7th we were leaving the house for Rita’s birthday
  dinner when we received a voicemail from James’ doctor. She said to call immediately and left her personal cell phone
    number. As we walked, James was being his usual self:
  running down Southport Ave and acting like a healthy, happy little
  boy. Forty-eight hours later, James would be in critical
  condition, on a ventilator, and fighting for his life.  Two days after
  that James was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Leukemia. When we called the doctor back, she shared that a routine blood test
  showed James’ white blood cell count was abnormally high and she
  wanted us to get more tests done by the Leukemia and cancer
  specialists at Lurie’s Children Hospital. To put it in
  perspective, healthy children usually have a white blood cell count of
  5,000 to 10,000. James’ was at 32,000. Thursday was the soonest appointment we could get with a hematologist
  - a doctor who specializes in diseases of the blood. The
  doctors at Lurie’s confirmed that something was not right. They wanted to get a bone marrow sample to figure out what was
  going on and the quickest way to the front of the line was to have
  James admitted. At that point, there wasn’t a high level
  of concern for James’ immediate health. We spent the day
  playing with trucks, reading books, watching “gee” (Curious George)
  and looking at cars, trucks, buses and all his favorite sights of the
  city from the hospital room window. On Friday morning at 9:30 am, James underwent a procedure to extract
  a bone marrow and a bone sample from his hip. The
  doctor’s shared what they were testing for: James likely either had
  Leukemia or an auto-immune disease. Devastation. A few hours later the oncologist (cancer doctor) called us to the
  consultation room for a discussion. She shared what was
  seemingly good news. The initial blood results had ruled
  out the most common types of Leukemia, which typically make up more
  than 99% of annual childhood Leukemia diagnosis. The
  only cancer they couldn’t rule out was a very rare form of Leukemia
  called Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML. We
  would later learn that JMML is so rare that there are currently only
  20 kids diagnosed in the U.S. While we didn’t yet have an answer for what was affecting James, we
  cautiously celebrated the news since the other options were an auto
  immune disease or pneumonia.  We were told the rest of the tests would
  likely come back on Monday. That night James’ health rapidly deteriorated. His
  temperature spiked to 104. His heart rate was racing at
  200 beats per minute. His lungs began to fail. To help his little body the nurses and doctors put him on
  oxygen and a few IVs. While we were scared – and not
  knowing what was happening – we at least had the benefit of being able
  to talk to the doctors. James didn’t. As the night progressed, the doctor’s wanted to increase his oxygen
  to help with his lungs; and to do so, he needed to be moved to the
  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and only they could administer
  the higher dosage. For the next 24-hours, James would not rest; his body would not let
    him. Each time he did fall asleep, he would wake up 10
  to 20 minutes later terrified and not knowing what was happening.  His
  body was in overdrive, IVs and sensors all over his body, a tube
  inserted down his nose into his stomach – how could he understand? It was excruciating. His body was being
    overworked. He was having trouble breathing. He was not getting the rest needed. He was
  pleading with all the words he had.  “All done.” “Momma.” “Up.”
  “Outside.” It was heartbreaking and terrifying to watch
  our poor little baby so scared and so sick, feeling completely helpless. The PICU team told us what we could already see.  James’ body
  could not sustain this pace on his own, so we made the decision to
  sedate and intubate him (put on a breathing machine.) It
  was mentally impossible to hear but we knew it had to be done.  We sat
  bedside with James as he was sedated and the breathing tubes inserted
  into his lungs.  This was two days after we walked into the hospital
  with a seemingly healthy little boy. Saturday brought a new bombshell. The only piece of
  good news we had received instantly disappeared. Our
  James had JMML, the rarest type of childhood Leukemia. The doctors now suspected that James did not have pneumonia. Instead it was leukemia filling his little lungs with white
  blood cells. James’ white blood cell count accelerated
  rapidly throughout the day from 30,000 (which we previously thought
  was unimaginably high) to 50,000 to 78,000 to 90,000 to 111,000 to 128,000. Our little James was now in critical condition. Some of
  the best doctors in Chicago were working with him minute-by-minute,
  hour-by-hour to keep him going. Everything had happened
  so fast that we didn’t even have time to process one bit of news
  before we had moved onto another. But we kept in mind
  one thing: if you’ve met James, you know he is a strong-willed little
    toddler. If anyone can battle this, it’s James. While James’ lungs were responding to the breathing machine, it
  wasn’t enough.  The doctors decided to move him to a
  new ventilator that could also administer anesthesia gas in addition
  to breathing for James.  This machine had to be brought up from the
  E.R. and had only been used a few times on the PICU floor over the
  past two years. We were told James may be the sickest
  patient in the hospital (438 patients) and that he was fighting for
  his life. We were grasping for straws. The doctors told us they
  were running out of things to try. We
  discussed unproven options that had never been tried on a patient as
  young as James. We signed consent forms. Fortunately, the new machine began to stabilize James and we took
  some of those options off the table.  During “rounds” the next
  morning we counted thirteen doctors and nurses around James’ room to
  get an update on his condition.  We felt like we were in the right
  place with the right level of attention from an incredibly experienced
  medical staff. We had tremendous support from family and
  friends – all rallying around James and supporting us day and night. On Sunday, August 12th- just 5 days after receiving that urgent
  call from the doctor - James started Chemo. His chemo is
  now administered twice a day. Once for
    30-minutes. Later in the day for 4-hours. He typically also requires a blood transfusion. This is in addition to the 18-25 drips of medication he is on
  every hour. As crazy as it sounds, this is only part of the story over the past
  week. There have been other challenges with blood
  pressure, his lungs filling with carbon dioxide (CO2), scary
  challenges switching him to new medical machinery, but tough little
  James is making progress. On Wednesday the 15th he moved
  to a smaller ventilator. His white blood cells are down
  to 30,000. While still on anesthesia, James has been resting in bed with his
  night time puppy, Curious George stuffed animal and a pacifier in one
  hand and his favorite toy truck in the other. We have
  been reading James books, which is very difficult while keeping your
  emotions in check. James has a long fight in front of him. It’s scary to
  think about all the challenges ahead but right now we are focused on
  today. One step at a time, then we will tackle the next target. Ultimately, the only cure for JMML is a bone marrow transplant, in
  addition to extensive chemotherapy over the coming months until we
  find the appropriate donor match. If you want to see if
  you would be a match for James, please register at the website below. Nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed with Leukemia this year. There are a lot of kids like James out there whose only hope is
  to find a good donor match. You can do it from your own
  home and it’s as easy as swabbing the inside of your cheek. Please visit: http://www.bethematch.org/ You can learn more about JMML at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers.  He’s the
  sweetest little boy you’ll ever meet. We can’t wait to
  hear his voice again. To see his kind blue eyes. To have him blow us a kiss with a smile. I love
    you James. You can donate to James’ care at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay",https://fundrazr.com/f1OA33
217,Please help Rika,,,,,"(spanish below) This wonderful friend has gone through more sorrow
  and pain than I can imagine, and these blows have taken their toll
  over the years. Over the last year she has struggled with blood clots
  in her foot and lungs and then got infected with erysipelas. She also
  suffers from fibromyalgia caused by the traumatic events of loosing
  her parents and four siblings. Rika is well educated and had a good
  job before illness overcame her and today she is unfit for work which
  has been very burdensome. The debts of her medical treatment and
  medication are piling up and she is unable to buy necessary service to
  improve her life. She is under hospital supervision once a week and the doctors
  struggle to find the right blood-thinning medication while she also
  suffers from serious side-effects due to the medication. Her doctor
  now wants her to try a new drug which is very expensive and it’s not
  so easy to finance the cost needed for these. All of this has severely
  reduced her quality of life. Me and everyone who loves this wonderful women would be eternally
  grateful if you could give a helping hand as she struggles with these
  hardships. All contributions count, no matter the amount you can offer. With hope and gratitude, thank you. Esta maravillosa amiga ha sufrido más tristeza y dolor de lo que puedo imaginar, son golpes duros que le han pasado factura a lo largo de los años. Durante el año pasado tuvo problemas con coágulos de sangre en el pie y los pulmones, y después sufrió una infección de erisipela. También padece fibromialgia, provocada por los eventos traumáticos de perder a sus padres y a sus cuatro hermanos. Rika ha tenido una buena educación, y tenía un buen trabajo antes de que la enfermedad la venciera. A día de hoy no puede trabajar, lo cual ha sido un gran peso para ella. Las deudas de su tratamiento médico y medicamentos se acumulan, y no puede costearse el servicio necesario para mejorar su vida.

Está bajo supervisión del hospital una vez por semana; los médicos luchan por encontrar el medicamento anticoagulante adecuado, mientras que ella también sufre efectos secundarios graves debido a la medicación. Ahora, su médico quiere que pruebe un nuevo medicamento muy caro, pero no es tan fácil financiar el coste necesario. Todo esto ha reducido severamente su calidad de vida.

Yo y todos los que amamos a esta maravillosa mujer te estaríamos eternamente agradecidos si pudieras ayudarnos mientras lucha con estas dificultades. Todas las contribuciones cuentan, sin importar la cantidad que puedas ofrecer.

    observing the UC San Diego holiday break from December 12th, 2019, until January 6th , 2020. Therefore processing time for kit orders
  may change. Delays may also be seen for international orders. As our labs will be closed during this time, we recommend
    sending samples in by December 18th. Samples sent during the break
    will be held up in the mail, which can lead to sample quality degradation. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This is a unique, open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and
  analyzed. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab about every 2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once
  your sample arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), processing takes 3-4
    months. We estimate that the whole process will take about
    4-6 months. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized
  interpretation . Results are uploaded via our
  participant website, which you will get access to once you register
  your kit. It will take longer than the expected 4-6 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has

    one Susan Thomas-Nichols was diagnosed a little over a month ago
    with advanced Multiple Myeloma a non-curable blood cancer. In honor
    of Sue we are reaching out to everyone to raise funds for Sue’s
    medical and family expenses. Due to this horrible disease she has
    been unable to work and will need help during this difficult time. This long road began when Sue started suffering from rib and
    back pain this winter. With the pain increasing she went to her
    primary care for answers and with some testing Sue was referred to a
    chiropractor for pain relief. After multiple chiropractic treatments
    the unbearable pain worsened so she was forced to check herself into
    the hospital with acute back pain and severe muscle spasms. After being admitted, Sue was ultimately diagnosed with eight
    fractured bones in her spine. The high calcium levels in her body
    caused the brittle bones which led to bone marrow testing and the
    cancer diagnosis. In addition to this devastating diagnosis Sue is
    still grieving the loss of her only child Michael, who passed away
    just a little over a year ago. Sue is the most kind and loving person and all who are blessed
    to know her are well aware she’s handling these burdens with faith,
    positivity and incredible strength, but however strong she is, she
    will need a great deal of support during this long journey. With the
    multiple treatments of chemotherapy, a stem cell and bone marrow
    transplant Sue will be unable physically to work for quite some
    time, and will need to focus all of her efforts and energy on her
    treatment and recovery. If at all possible, any contribution that you can make will help
    ease the stress of the financial burden that she and her family will
    face in her long battle with this disease and will be greatly
    appreciated. We would also appreciate it if you could share Sue’s
    story and help us rally together and support Sue’s long journey
    ahead and thank everyone dearly for all your love and support.",https://fundrazr.com/supportsueinkca

"1,395",Please help us pay for Brion's medical bills,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,12,"Brion came down to Tennessee to visit me on February 15. He started
  to have headaches and vomiting on the 16. On February 19, Brion
  started to loose his eyesite. The next day we went to a walk-in eye
  doctor. There they dialated his eye and found he had blood on the
  retinas. From there they sent us directly to an eye specialist that
  got us in right away. At the specialist they took pictures of his eyes and took his blood
  pressure. We met with the dr. for maybe ten minutes. He said there was
  nothing he could do for Brion since his blood pressure was so high. He
  told us to go directly to the hospital. That is exactly what we did. While at the ER, Brion's blood pressure was 225/137. He could have
  stoked out and died. They also found out that his kidneys were only
  functioning at 5%.  They admited him and put him in the CCU (ICU) for
  5 days. They ran many tests. That Saturday they drew 21 viles of blood
  just to find out what was going on. They continued to draw blood work
  everyday. They started a treatment of dialysis and plasma transfusions. It wasn't until a week later we found our Brion has a very rare blood
  disease. The diagnosis is (aHUS). Only 1 in every 500,000 people have
  this. There is no cure for it. He continues to be on dialysis three days a week. He is also having
  iv meds that are $18,000 a dose once a week for the first five
  weeks and has changed to every other week.  His blood doctor is
  hopeful that the iv meds will work and he will regain function in his kidney. Not to mention he will be droppd from his Michigan insurance and had
  to get a brand new insurance policy and pay the out of pocket maximum
  on top of the one we already matched for his Michigan policy. Brion and I ask that you send prayers our way. If you are willing
  to donate money to help with his medical bills any and all help are welcomed. We greatly appreciate each and every one of you.",https://fundrazr.com/5xhg1
"3,724",Support & Medical Expenses for Shannon & Ryder,Canadian Dollar,,of $100k goal,41,"FORMER MISS CANADA LOSES ALL
    WHILE FIGHTING CONTROVERSIAL DISEASE Shannon Smadella once
        represented Canada on the world’s stage, volunteering thousands
        of un-paid hours for charity, and now she is the one who needs help - and she needs it - yesterday Shannon Needs Your Help Shannon & Ryder need your help. 
    Shannon was Miss Canada and represented this country with pride,
    volunteering thousands of unpaid hours for charity and humanitarian
    work. But when Shannon needed help, Canada's medical system (infectious disease) falls short
        of helping her. For the past fifteen months
    Shannon, who is her family's sole provider, has suffered multiple
    diagnosis including the controversial “Lyme Disease”. Unable to
    work, Shannon has been forced to sell everything she owns and resort
    to using the services of her local food bank. This has taken a
    severe emotional toll on her eight year old son Ryder. Diagnosed With Multiple
      Life-Threatening Illnesses Shannon has been diagnosed with multiple severe and chronic
      (life threatening) illnesses and due to the debilitating
    nature of even just one of them, she has not been able to work since
    April of 2018 (where she went on medical leave from her position as
    a Mortgage Specialist with RBC). Shannon suffers with severe
    seropositive ++ Rheumatoid Arthritis affecting over 48 of
      her joints, which has left her at multiple times unable to walk
      without support or even get out of bed. This once
    extremely healthy and fit international yoga instructor of twelve
    years is now living on over 20 prescription medications and 17 herbal supplements daily (some of which are the ‘last
    resort’ remedy including biological and chemotherapy treatments).
    She is being treated by her GP, NDs, and Specialists for multiple
    severe and chronic diagnosis’, (RA, Diabetes, and multiple growths
    in vital organs). In the past 18 months, she has attended to over 100 medical appointments and tests .
    Thirty-six cortisone joint injections allow her to walk and get out
    of bed; however immense damage has settled in to her dominant wrist
    causing permanent disability. She has had her left
    knee aspirated four times to date with multiple vials of fluid
    extracted on each occasion. In addition she takes a daily oral
    steroid, an immune-suppressant, and low does Chemotherapy
    (Methotrexate).  She is in extreme pain.  Although she has some of
    the best specialists in Rheumatology and is receiving top notch
    treatment for her RA (to the extent that they are able to provide),
    numerous symptoms proceed to exist which is extremely troubling for
    Shannon. Shannon, whom is also an insulin
    dependent as a type 1 diabetic, spends multiple hours feeling both
    fatigued but also physically unwell due to her unstable sugars.  As
    a result, her A1C ( a blood test that reflects your
        average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months), has been
        extremely elevated  (above 8) since her RA treatment have
        started, potentially resulting in additional serious health issues. A Global Humanitarian Shannon has given so much to her
    community and the world, and now she requires the help of
      her community and the world. In her 37 years of life,
    she has helped over 88 charities and organizations
        raise over 3 million dollars, donating over $100,000
    personally . She has volunteered over 3000 un-paid
    hours to various organizations and has traveled Canada speaking to
    school children about the important of inner beauty and self
    confidence during her rein as Miss Canada .  In
    2010, she rode her bicycle over 4000 km across Canada and the US to
    raise funds and awareness for the Canadian and American Red Cross
    organizations.  This woman has devoted her life to helping others
    and lives her life by the Yogic principles ( Yamas ). Forced to sell everything Unable to work, Shannon has been forced to sell everything she owns and has lost a
    valuable life insurance policy that was in place to support her son,
    given anything happen to her.  If Shannon does not get the help she
    needs, she is also at risk of losing her first home, not to mention
    - her life. In March of 2019, after testing at
    one of the most comprehensive and renowned labs in the world for
    diagnosing chronic infections originating from tick-borne diseases,
    Armin Labs, in Germany, it was found that Shannon also
      suffers from multiple chronic infections including Borrelia
      burgdorferi, afzelii as well as three other viral co-infections,
      commonly and collectively diagnosed as ‘Lyme Disease’. Due to the controversy and politics
    associated with the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in Canada (the US and other
    countries like Germany are years ahead in research, testing and
    treatment), Shannon has been unable to receive any support
      from her conventional medical professionals specifically in
      infectious disease , regarding her bacterial and viral
    infections, and thus has multiple symptoms remaining untreated. 
    These include neurological symptoms like tremors, as well as loss of
    feeling in her limbs, migraines, tinnitus, cracking and stiffness in
    her neck, heart palpitations, chest pain, memory loss - just to name
    a few.  She was told by the infectious disease department in
    Vancouver that Canada's text produce multiple false negatives, and
    are therefore unreliable.  She has been unable to receive other
    testing in Canada or treatment for that matter.   <<< Lyme Resources>>> In 2018 alone, she had to spend tens
    of thousands out of pocket on uninsured medical treatments.  In
    Canada, only some services are covered, but a large number are not. 
    Furthermore, specialists for each diagnosis focus on the issue
    specific to their specialty, resulting in Shannon having to see
    multiple specialists to treat her multiple diagnosis', which to date include: Severe Seropositive ++ Rheumatoid Arthritis Type 1 Diabetes Polymyalgia Rheumatica Multiple Cycts & Fibroid Growths (Ovary, Breast, Uterus, Gal-Bladder) Multiple Chronic Infections:
      Chlamydia pneumoniae IgG and IgA strong positive, Coxsakievirus
      IgA positive, ECHO virus IgA positive, and Borrelia burgdorferi,
      afzelii (commonly referred to as Lyme Disease ) Unfortunately, our Canadian system
    has yet to come up with collective efforts to treat the person as a
    whole, and many residents are resorting to treatment at private
    facilities such as the Mayo Clinic.  As it is impossible for Shannon
    to regain her health through so many diagnosis' and specialists, it is imperative that she seek treatment at a private
      facility that can mange her case as a ""whole"", and have
      further diagnostics to get to the root of all of these collective
      illnesses. Sadly, private conventional treatments,
    appointment fees, and testing are not covered by Health Canada, so
    Shannon is out of pocket for these expenses. Her treatment
      will cost close to $50,000.00... As a side note, hundreds of other Canadians are also having to
      resort to seeking treatment at these clinics, most out of country. The Costs She has exhausted all of her resources and desperately needs
      your help. By helping to get her story out, you will not
    only help Shannon & Ryder raise the funds needed to receive
    additional treatment, and receive support for basic survival, but
    you'll ensure that numerous other Canadians do not have to go
    through what Shannon has. Total medical expenses already incurred:  $50,000 Funding needed for upcoming medical expenses: $50,000+ ( Please click

"4,850",Join friends in raising funds to help Jim Butler pay medical expenses,U.S. Dollar,,of $30k goal,24,"We are Chez and Kay, friends and colleagues of the
    Andersen-Butler family. In June 2019 Jim Butler came down with a
    form of dermatomyositis, statin-induced necrotizing myopathy, a very
    rare autoimmune disease that caused the debilitating condition
    rhabdomyolysis. The effect of the disease is the destruction and loss of muscle
    fibers, which are released into the bloodstream. Jim quickly became
    incapacitated—currently he can only move his arms, hands, neck and feet. As of November 1st, Jim has been in a hospital or facility for
    118 days, with 5 times in and out of the ICU, and 2 surgeries (a
    stomach stent and a tracheostomy). His nurses commend him on the
    stamina and spirit he shows after these months of grappling with
    this life-threatening and painful disease. The good news is that the
    rhabdomyolysis is finally under control, but Jim is facing a long
    road ahead of rehabilitation and recovery, as well as mounting
    medical costs (despite having insurance). These add an extra burden
    of concern, given that Jim is self-employed and has already lost
    months of income. We started this campaign because we want to raise funds to help
    the Andersen-Butlers cover Jim’s associated medical expenses. Our
    goal is to raise $30,000 before New Year’s Eve. Tina and Jim value friends and family, and they have been
    unfailingly generous in support of their community. Jim has always
    given freely of his time, energy, and his skills in the mechanical,
    electrical, plumbing, and carpentry realms. He would regularly stop
    in to keep a lonely neighbor company, anonymously mow the lawn or
    shovel the driveway for an elderly widow, or head out in the middle
    of a wintry night to fix a friend’s furnace. Jim has been widely respected and well-loved in his professional
    capacities. With his brother Ed, he installed the solar hot-water
    system on the White House during Jimmy Carter’s administration.  Jim
    travelled internationally as stage manager for the Paul Winter
    Consort, and for 30 years has played an integral role in the annual
    Winter Solstice Celebrations in New York, including co-designing
    what have now become traditional elements of the shows, such as the
    28-foot Solstice Tree of sounds. Please, if you are able, make a contribution to help towards
    covering these daunting expenses, and/or lift Jim’s spirits with

270,Help Jaxson get colorblind glasses,U.S. Dollar,,of $349 goal,9,"Help Jaxson See The World In Color! Jaxson will turn 8 in May of 2019.
      He is color blind. He has strong proton color blindness. This
      means that his red cones don't detect enough red and are too
      sensitive to greens, yellows and organs. As a result, greens,
      yellows, oranges, reds and browns appear the same especially in
      low light. He also has difficulty telling blues from purples and
      pinks from grays. Jaxson is a sweet kid and is well adapted to having color blindness
    but it does make somethings more difficult. You really take for
    granted how much you rely on seeing color. There are many common
    things that Jaxson struggles with: picking out clothes that match,
    finding the right color of LEGO while building a kit, seeing print
    on a colored background, and even seeing his bobber while fishing. I took him to try the color blind glasses out because he told me
    that he just wanted to see what the world was really like. He
    described seeing colors for the first times as amazing and
    mind-blowing! He told me that he saw colors that he never saw before
    like red, purple and pink. He told me that he doesn't want me to get him the glasses because
    he is okay with how God made him and he doesn't want me to spend
    that much money on him. I would like to get him these for his
    birthday so that he doesn't feel as if we are spending tons of money
    on him. His lenses will cost about $469. This is the cost with the frames.
    We are hoping that insurance maybe able to cover the frames.
    Insurance will not cover anything for the lenses. Please help us let Jaxson see the world in color! WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/01UhUc
"2,850",Please help me #keepmoving #outdoors with an #Alinker Walking Bike.,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,39,"Hi! I’m David. Please help me #keepmoving outdoors with an #Alinker
  Walking Bike. I'm a single Dad and would love to be able to enjoy the
  outdoors again with my daughter and friends. Diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at age 2, I spent most of my
  youth in and out of a wheelchair and in and out of hospitals. After
  many years and total joint replacements in both hips and knees, I
  became more mobile and began participating in outdoor activities with
  the assistance of several local non-profit groups that assist the
  disabled in the participation of sports such as hiking, kayaking,
  sailing and more. However, in early 2018, I had to have a second knee replacement (on
  the same knee) and later that year, I fell and since then, I have not
  been able to walk without assistance.  I currently use crutches
  outside and a walker in the home.  I have not participated in any
  outdoor activities for over a year. I no longer go for walks, regular
  grocery shopping, go to malls or other public venues.  Walking with
  crutches while having Rheumatoid Arthritis causes added pain in my
  back, neck and shoulders.  This pain along with an overall fear of
  falling prevents me from going out, enjoying the great outdoors in New
  England and being socially active as I had been before the knee
  replacement and subsequent fall. I attend Physical Therapy several
  days a week and am trying to get some strength back. The #Alinker is a three-wheeled walking bike designed to help people
  stay active and live life to the fullest allowing users experience
  chronic aches and pains, chronic illnesses and recovering from an
  injury, they can all still be active! Currently, Health Insurance
  plans do not cover a very broad range of mobility devices and that’s
  why campaigns like this are so important. I'd be able to rebuild and
  maintain muscle tone in my legs, be able to walk upright instead of
  using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall and once again
  enjoy my time outdoors and with family and friends without the feeling
  like I'm slowing everyone down. It may even allow me to return to
  scuba diving as I'd be able to use the #Alinker to walk the trail down
  to the water's edge at Ft. Wetherill park in Jamestown, RI.  to It
  really would give me so much freedom back, open up my world again, and
  change my life. To learn more about my life’s journey, please visit me

  circumstances that prior used crowdfund Youcaring merged with GoFundMe
  and by their policy is Mexico a Non-GoFundMe supported Country

  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the

  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.

    that many of you know, has a son named Woody who has live in Hawaii
    for about 10 years. Many of you also know that he has been diagnosed
    with Throat and Neck Cancer .  He has undergone 2
    surgeries thus far and will have to follow up with 6 and a half
    weeks of Radiation. The bills are piling up and will continue as
    Woody goes through these treatments. He not only has the hospital,
    doctors, surgery, medications and treatments to pay for, he will
    have to pay for transportation to and from as he does not have
    family near to help with these needs. Jean and her daughter have
    been there with Woody through the surgeries but will need to return
    home soon.  He has a few friends/family that are trying to make
    arrangements to go spend time with him as he goes thru this but he
    has no one there full time so assistance will be needed and need to
    be paid for as well.  Woody also had a 6 year old son, and his is
    the only income for he and his son.  I would like to pass this on
    and see if we can all pitch in and help this family out. The bible
    tells us in Hebrews 13:16, Do not neglect to do good and share what we
        have with others, for such sacrifices please God. Please share this with your friends and donate as you feel led to.

  limits on myself and what I could or could not do. I always tried if
  it was something I wanted to do I tried and tried again. Sometimes it
  didn’t work out but most times, I could figure out a way to get things
  done. As I’ve become an adult I’m not as strong as I once was, but I
  have yet to give up my “unstoppable” spirit. Throughout the years I
  have found different ways to help myself stay independent and mobile.

"8,525",Please help Matthew!,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,28,"Matthew and his sister Tiffani were born with what is called CVID,
  common variable immunodeficiency.  Both were being treated under a
  Professor,with the medication called Octagam once a month through an
  IV drip.Matthew had an unfortunate experience in the last month, where
  he had a reaction to the Octagam and caused him to end up in hospital
  having lumbar punctures, MRI scans and sonars.  Unfortunately he is
  now unable to receive the Octagam as its a gamble as to whether or not
  he would have the same issues happen again. The option now is to move
  to the subcutaneous medication which is extremely costly. The medical
  aid will cover a portion of this every month, but I am short R5000 per
  month on a 4 week month and R10000 on a 5 week month.  There is also
  the cost of a pump to purchase of over R8000 which medical aid does
  not cover. If I cannot raise enough money, Matthew will not receive
  the correct amount of medication each month, which could lead to more
  infections.  Matthew and I are requesting any form of support no
  matter how big or small that you can give us to help him lead a normal
  healthy life. Thanks to all the local and international kind hearted
  people matt could start his therapy on his correct level for this
  month. It’s been a very trying time for the past two days but my
  little boy has managed to be so brave. I can only thank the support we
  have received, please don’t stop with the support",https://fundrazr.com/11Ko66
"54,685",Jasper's fund,U.S. Dollar,,of $200k goal,539,"The past month has been the most excruciating I have ever known but
  within it has been Jaspers fight for life. Each day of the first 3
  weeks had presented numerous challenges both large and small and he
  has shown thus far that he is meeting them. He is now physically stable. Jasper suffered a major seizure the evening of 2/12/16. The
  severity of which has left him with anoxic brain injury (this is
  similar to a stroke). The complexity of this condition and the
  complete unknown aspect of what lies ahead in terms of recovery is
  what is being faced at this time. Jasper has weathered the
  'neurological storms' that came upon him as a result of this injury.
  These were very severe and difficult to bear. Doctors stated that
  these ""storms"" could last days, weeks, years or never cease.
  The absolutely wonderful news is his neurological storms have subsided
  after less than a month and he has been slowly awakening from this state. He has begun to move both legs, move his eyes ( visual
  tracking) and to turn his head. Very positive steps forward. He
  responds to touch and stimuli and a few times- though not yet
  consistent-we saw a smile......it was beautiful to see! Julianne, Jasper's mom (03/29/16) What we do know is that his recovery is going to be a long
  road. He is facing years of rehabilitation, initially in a
  facility equipped to deal with rebuilding his physical  and cognitive
  abilities. This is going to be costly and we need your help . Your generous donations will be
  used to ensure that Jasper is able to get the care he needs to reclaim

"1,435",Finn's Cuddle Bear Book Drive,U.S. Dollar,,of $1k goal,30,"Let's meet Finn: Finn Sawyer was an avocado-loving, energetic, and intelligent little
  boy who loved playing with friends, reading books, and doing all the
  other childhood things that little boys do. Like his namesakes Huck
  Finn & Tom Sawyer he craved adventure, laughed often, and loved
  the outdoors. In August of 2016, Finn was diagnosed with a tumor in
  his bladder/prostate, which turned out to be a rare cancer called
  rhabdomyosarcoma. In the space of a year and a half, Finn endured a
  failed primary treatment, major surgery to remove his bladder, and
  subsequently relapsed for a second time. In March of 2017 Finn ended up at the Mayo Clinic where a world-class
  team of surgeons and doctors performed two all-day surgeries that were
  afterward described as heroic and nearly unprecedented for a child of
  Finns age. After removing Finn’s rectum, sections of pelvic bone,
  lymph nodes, and any other abdominal soft-tissue that could host
  future tumors clear margins were achieved and Finn began the recovery
  process. Finn then began a chemotherapy regimen that was by and far
  the most intense he had ever experienced. Everyone prayed that what
  had been done was enough. A short couple months later, however, Finn’s next scan showed two
  tumors growing in his pelvic cavity. Once more Finn wound up at the
  Mayo Clinic where the same team prepped for another heroic surgery –
  but things were to turn out differently this time. Finn’s cancer had
  spread throughout his entire abdomen. Despite the continuous efforts
  by Finn’s family and medical team all the way up to his final moments,
  in the early morning hours of Sunday December 2, 2018 Finn finished
  his race and went home to be with Jesus. He ran the race that was set
  before him, and he ran it with all his might. He fought the good fight
  and finished the race. The impact that such a small boy had and
  continues to have on such a big world is astounding. Our Mission: In honor of Finn Sawyer, we are giving sets of Cuddle Bear books
    and stuffed bears to kids in need. Each sponsored set will directly
    go to a child at the Mayo Clinic.  What a comfort to have a story
    about being loved AND a bear that you can hold onto when you're
    going through a hard and scary time. Sometimes it's the little
    things that mean the most - the cuddles and hugs that get you
    through fear and pain. And YOU can join us... To sponsor a child and give a Cuddle Bear book and stuffed animal set is only $25. But guess
    what!?!? The company I work with, Usborne Books & More, is
    matching our donations at 50% once we get 10 Sponsors!!!  How
    amazing is that?! That means for every set you purchase they donate
    an additional bear or book AND they give to cancer research!!! Your
    impact is getting multiplied!! Together we can achieve more! Here's how to help... Donate $25 to Sponsor 1 child (or more...ie $50 will sponsor 2
    children) and each sponsored child will receive a Cuddle Bear Book
    & Bear. Please also help spread the word! Know a family affected
    by cancer? Ask them to help. Know a doctor or nurse on the front
    lines of care? Ask them to join us. Are you on social media? Share

530,Amying High Against Cancer,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,18,"If you know Amy, you know kindness, compassion, and empathy. These
  three things have been cornerstones not only in Amy's former job in
  human rights, writing the testimony of those that have suffered
  greatly or helping the families of Americans imprisoned abroad, but
  they are the foundation in how she lives her life. Always loving,
  always caring, always supportive, always looking for the helpers, and
  always trying to be a helper.  I was lucky enough to work beside her
  to see her heart, dedication, passion, and drive first hand. In January, Amy began getting very ill. She experienced hair
  loss, extreme fatigue, vision issues, focus and concentration issues,
  memory problems, pain, and overall weakness. She went to the doctor
  thinking it was her thyroid. A CBC marked an abnormal white blood cell
  count and abnormal platelet count. This is where her journey to
  diagnosis began. After several vials of blood, imaging tests, doctor
  appointments, and appointments with specialists, Amy was diagnosed
  with aCML, or atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, a very rare type of
  blood cancer with no standard treatment protocol. The prognosis for
  aCML is on average  24 months.  The only curative measure is a stem
  cell transplant and the success of such a procedure not only carries
  its own risk but isn't guaranteed. There are also clinical trials that
  offer hope. Besides aCML, there is a mystery secondary diagnosis that
  is causing a lot of adverse health issues for Amy. They are currently
  doing additional labs and tissue biopsies to determine what this is
  and how to treat both the aCML and the secondary diagnosis in concert.
  Viral, bacterial, fungal and autoimmune diseases have all been ruled
  out. This issue needs to be identified before more aggressive
  treatment can begin. Until then, Amy's care is diagnostic
  or palliative in nature. Right now, life is difficult for Amy.  Her cancer has caused her
  liver and spleen to become enlarged, an enlargement of her thyroid
  makes swallowing difficult, she wakes up in a great deal of pain --
  bone pain, muscle pain, organ pain -- and she now has double vision,
  loss of appetite, weakness and fatigue have gotten worse, and she now
  has constant nausea.   Her days are spent at home or at the doctors'
  offices. In one week, she had four doctor appointments for labs. In 60
  days, she has had over forty-four blood labs performed. a bone marrow
  biopsy and aspiration, and six imaging exams. In September, she had
  abdominal surgery to remove four enlarged lymph nodes in her abdomen.
  She caught pneumonia from surgery. Her oncologist is recommending a
  splenectomy. Her g astroenterologist wants to explore
  liver issues. Her otolaryngologist wants to remove her thyroid. As those who know Amy know, she also has a child on the autism
  spectrum. While independence is also the goal for her child, she still
  requires guidance and care. This has added to the difficulties of
  dealing with this diagnosis. Amy has dedicated her life to her
  daughter, including homeschooling her when area public schools could
  not provide a suitable education, and despite her illness, she does
  not want life to change for her daughter and for her daughter to carry
  the burden of having a sick parent. Amy is an exceptional human being. She's the kindest, wisest person I
  know. If anyone can be the exception and not the rule, it's Amy.
  Despite facing real difficulties and tragedies in her life, Amy has
  not allowed life to make her bitter. She continues to look for the
  helpers, celebrates the best of us, and reads while she's doing it.
  Always a book in her hand, that one.  We have faith if anyone can beat
  the odds, it's her. She's had a whole life of beating the odds. Money raised for Amy will be used for respite care,
  transportation and lodging costs. It will also offset costs for things
  that insurance does not cover that will make life easier and more
  comfortable for Amy and her family.  It is our hope to eliminate some
  of these unanticipated costs and stress for Amy and her family.",https://fundrazr.com/amygetslit
"1,668",New Lungs for Yourvette,U.S. Dollar,,of $10.2k goal,26,"Hello, I am Yourvette Price-Davis. I retired on a medical disability
  at 49yrs old from The Muskegon County Prosecutor's Office. I was
  diagnosed with Severe Emphysema in July 2001, I worked until January
  2010. This awful, and progressive disease is due to my smoking
  cigarettes and it has cost me my career, my livelihood, and my
  independence. Until just recently I thought I would die with the
  disease (which has now worsened and caused another Lung disease called
  Pulmonary Hypertension). On March 18, 2019 I started a new journey at
  Spectrum Heart and Lung Transplant Clinic. On June 21, 2019 the
  process was completed by a meeting where Healthcare Professionals met
  regarding all the findings after 6 weeks of testing 2-3 times per
  week. Praise God it was favorable. They decided that I was eligible
  for a Double Lung Transplant! I had met the criteria, oh what a day
  that was for me. Thank You Lord! Now they just need approval from my
  Insurance which they recieved on July 5, 2019. Another blessed day in
  my life. My Financial Coordinator told me I have great Insurance and
  it will cover my entire surgery and medication I'll need for the rest
  of my life. However, there is one part that I need your help with. The
  Anti-Rejection Meds, they far exceed the monthly allowance of my
  Prescription Benefit. They are temporary meds for 6 months and are
  extremely expensive, more than I have. The Spectrum Financial
  Coordinator has told me that I will need $10,200.00 This will cover
  two calendar years,  this year and next.  Or any two years if I'm not
  transplanted til next year it will cover 2020 and 2021 if need be.
  Whatever you can donate I truly appreciate it, $5-$500 or more if so
  led. This surgery will allow me to live again. I'm so grateful for
  this opportunity.  So, if you can help me I thank you and ask that you
  share as well. God Bless you, Yourvette Cash App: $Yourvette",https://fundrazr.com/51XYvd
"33,550",Urgent Support Needed for Tony Dowling's Cancer Journey!,Australian Dollar,,of $60k goal,99,"Hi, my names Matt my wife and I have been friends with Tony and Tracy for nearly twenty
    years. They are a beautiful family and it was such a shock when I
    got the call from Tony recently telling me of his cancer diagnosis! I’m sure most of you have been following his journey as we have
    and are sending a constant stream of love, positive thoughts and
    prayers their way. I spoke again with Tony last week and heard the n ews of
    the new diagnosis and upgrade from stage 1 to stage 4. Truly heartbreaking to hear, but Tony is as positive and
    faith-filled as always, a true inspiration, we stand strong with
    them believing for a full recovery! He told me briefly of some of the struggles of dealing with the
    unexpected expenses and also the obvious loss of income etc. but
    expressed that he knows that God has it all under control and that he is confident of a positive outcome. After our chat I got off the phone and probably like many of you
    who are not physically located near Tony and Tracy in Sydney
    Australia, I thought to myself, there has to be something we can do to help, so I have set up this campaign in
    the hope that you will all join us in standing together to help make
    a massive difference to Tonys journey! Following is a snapshot of the Dowling family, a link to Tony’s
    journey so far which you can follow and the reasons why our
    donations are so very vital and impactful at this time for them... Tony is 46 years old and has been married to
  Tracy for 19 yrs. They live on the northern beaches of Sydney with
  their two boys Max 16 and Noah 14. The family is heavily involved in
  local basketball through the boy's school and the Manly representative
  level comps. Tracy is involved at the boy's school and helps
  co-ordinate and manage multiple basketball teams. Tony has a background as a school teacher,
  business entrepreneur and currently works in training and software
  development. They are active members of the local community, and
  church and love travelling, family time and adventures of any kind. Tony and Tracy have impacted the lives of so many people around the
  globe and locally with their big hearts and generous souls. We all have been positively influenced by this amazing couple in some
  shape or form, through either school, community, business or church
    life. Here is a link where you can follow Tony’s journey and progress: https://www.mylifeline.org/invitation/FOTY/b53c54fcc2abfed6f3d977439df0c4c309e98f36fff675b0772a480f52894be2 How we can help: Tony has just had surgery to remove bowel cancer which has also
  spread to his right lung. Tony’s diagnosis has now jumped from stage 1 to stage 4! This means that it is full steam ahead for aggressive chemotherapy
  treatment for the next 6 mths, followed by lung surgery around
  November 2019. They are in the process of trying to access some insurance funds, but
  there is a 3 mth waiting period that is not covered and then funds
  will still only cover 3/4 of normal income. On top of that, there are all the additional medical bills, hospital
  expenses, gap payments, medications and day to day additional expenses
  that come with this type of treatment... We want Tony, Tracy and the boys to be able to focus on the important
  things and keep any additional stress to a minimum. We would like to
  provide enough to get them through this 4 month transition period and
  also give them a buffer so that there is not a financial burden and
  pressure on them over the next 6 months. We would like to enable Tracy to not have to take up any additional
  work to cover any shortfall and added expenses, but be able to spend
  the time with Tony and attend to all the necessary appointments and
  give him all the required care and attention needed at this time. After calculating the amount needed to cover their everyday expenses
  keeping them afloat and to keep life as normal as possible, plus
  enough to help cover their ongoing medical costs for the next 6
  months, we have set a goal to raise $60K. Anything above that will go towards any additional ongoing medical
  expenses and treatment required. We kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless Tony
        and his family at this time as they link arms and stand together
        with friends, and family near and far to fight this nasty thing
        head on! If we all give what we can and share this with our various
        friends and networks then Tony and His family’s journey will be
        made so much easier by us all joining together to show how much
        we care! Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1TtQ0
275,Victoria’s PCOS Journey,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,2,"After 9 long years, we finally know the cause of my abdominal pain
  and I have been officially diagnosed with PCOS. PCOS stands for Polycystic ovary syndrome, and ""is a hormonal
  disorder common among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may
  have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone
  (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections
  of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs."" - The
  Mayo Clinic https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439 I currently have a cyst on my right ovary that is about 2 cm in size,
  nearly encapsulating the ovary, and it looks to be growing from the
  inside of it. With PCOS, there's always a chance that the cyst can
  burst and if it is growing internally rather than externally, it could
  take the whole ovary with it. While I can have the cyst surgically
  removed, it won't prevent future ones from growing. PCOS can be
  treated with birth control and other medications to prevent future
  cysts from growing, but because I have had issues with birth control
  in the past I am more focused on fixing this with surgery. As far as my liver hemagiomas go, I do now have four confirmed
  hemangiomas and possibly a fifth that was spotted during my most
  recent abdominal and pelvic MRIs that I had done on 10/31/2019. Those
  are still an issue that could also jeopardize my health, but in the
  meantime our focus is going to be on this cyst. For the time being, I have no choice but to continue working since I
  still have no PTO left from the absences I took in September. I do
  have FMLA in place to protect me if the pain becomes too excruciating
  for me to go to work, but even that is limited and it is unpaid leave.
  I have racked up a lot of medical debt in this process of figuring out
  what's been causing my pain, and my hope is to not only get caught up
  on those, but to also save for surgery if that's going to be an option
  for me. Anything is greatly appreciated, even if it’s just sharing the
  campaign. And if you’ve made it this far, I thank you for your time
  and attention.",https://fundrazr.com/91Z8D6

150,Help me get Enchroma glasses for my 8 year old son <3,U.S. Dollar,,of $369 goal,5,"Hello, my name is Melissa. I am the
    mother of 6 wonderful children. My husband and I manage a campground
    in Colorado. While we are originally from Iowa, my husband was born
    in Colorado and we recently moved back here to be closer to his
    dad.  We have lived here for two years and love it here in Colorful Colorado! To begin my story,  lets go back to when my husband and I lived in
    Iowa. We had 3 children at the time, and were pregnant with our
    fourth.  We worked our 6-3 jobs and took the kids to daycare early.
    It was routine for a really long time. Brayden changed all that. 
    Brayden was due to be born 10/10/10. However, he decided that was
    too far out to wait any longer, and was instead he entered our world
    on July 29, 2010. He weighed in at 3 lbs 5 oz and was 15 1/2 inches
    long. We spent 6 weeks in the NICU in Iowa City, which was
    approximately 1 and 1/2 hours from our home. My husband and I
    traveled to see him nearly every day, only missing 6 days out of the
    total time Brayden spent there. We were blessed to have family back
    home to help us with our other 3 children who were just getting
    ready to go back to school from summer break. He soon was able to transfer to a local hospital where he spent 3
    more weeks before being able to finally come home, one week before
    his initial due date. He came home on oxygen and so I spent six more
    weeks toting around an oxygen tank anywhere we had to go.  Brayden
    went to occupational therapy and continued to receive additional
    assistance throughout his early school years. I am happy to report
    Brayden has recently achieved all milestones and is now on an equal
    playing field as all other kids his age! Brayden has always worn glasses from a pretty young age, but it was
    only at a recent eye exam that I learned that he is moderately
    red-green color blind. Wow, what an eye opener! Now thinking back,
    it may explain some things. I have more than once seem him trip over
    the same object on the floor. An object similar in color to the
    floor itself. But perhaps more importantly would be his often times
    pouty and dismal attitude...how boring the world must be without
    certain colors! I recently have learned about Enchroma eye glasses. I have watched
    the videos and now imagine the day I can get Brayden a pair. Of
    course the price tag is not cheap, as with anything worthwhile.
    Especially considering he would need prescription glasses on top of
    it.  With 6 children to raise, it seems pretty far away before I can
    fit these in our budget.  I have seen what crowdfunding can do and
    so hey...I am coming to my family, friends and fellow members of
    society.. Can you help me out?? I would love to be able to give my
    son the gift of color!  Living here in Colorful Colorado, it would
    be an astonishing gift! His birthday is coming up! I appreciate you
    taking the time to read our story. God bless! WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/c1SvH9

"10,830",Stan Romanek Medical /Life FundRazer,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,148,"I'm adding the story behind this fund raiser so you may
    understand who, what, when, where and most importantly why. Who: Stan Romanek is an ordinary man who experiences
    Extraordinary events. Stan is an innocent individual who has been
    convicted of a horrendous crime. A crime against children. Stan
    maintains his innocence, and his friends and family stand by his
    side knowing he would never harm a child, not even by looking at
    pictures of abuse by others. Stan is a father,stepfather, step-Papa, husband, brother, son,
    friend and a lifeline of understanding & support to many people
    around the world. What: It all began in Dec. 2000 when Stan witnessed and
    documented his first UFO. His experiences of contact with ETs/UFO's
    still continues just not as often. More....What: Over the past 17 years Stan has endured threats,
    physical assaults, being shot at, called a fraud and worse. Stan has also received love, praise, thanks, respect, from
    around the world, and according to some a little fame. Netflix
    movie, EXTRAORDINARY:The Stan Romanek Story is a documentary about
    his life and experiences. In 2013 A detective named Koopman arrived at Stan's home with
    a search warrant, an armed SWAT Team, and 2 persons from a forensics
    lab. The team spent 2 1/2 hours in his home, searching. They found
    no evidence of what they were searching for. ( What...Child Porn) No
    disk, no jump drive, no picture, or any trace on any computer!!!! When: April 2013...search warrant When: February 2014 Stan was arrested. He spent 12 hours in
    jail. That's how long it takes to bail someone out. When: 4 1/2 years after the search warrant, August 2017 Stan
    was found guilty of possesion of CP by a 12 member jury. Stan does not blame the jury. They weren't give all of the
    evidence in this case. They weren't allowed to know that Det.
    Koopman had faced his own felony charges in 2016 for basically lying
    to a judge in a murder case pre-trial. He was found not guilty.
    However, the detective was placed on a Brady list. A list for police
    officers who lie in their official capacity. No one could tell the jury about this in Stan's trial, they
    didn't know of the other cases the Det. lied in or that there were 2
    civil lawsuits against the detective. A lot of evidence and witnesses provided for Stan's defense
    was not allowed or were limited in what they could say. This is not how the justice system us supposed to work.
    Innocent people found guilty and guilty people found innocent???? Where: Loveland Colorado, Larimer County. Why: WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO STAN?? The reason is simple. Silence the messenger! Our therory is that the evidence found 10 months after the
    search warrant was planted. The evidence proves our therory!!!
    Evidence not seen by the jury! How: Malicious activity!!! Virus with backdoor access, a bad
    cop, a dark agency bent on silencing Stan, someone who simply didn't
    agree with Stan's message of the ET/UFO reality????? Who knows!?! The end of this Story is still to be written. On October 19, 2017 Stan will appear in court for sentencing. Nothing can change that fact. The judge is a good judge, and
    Stan's fate is in her hands. What can be done to finish this Story? Please share this
    fundraiser. Donate whatever amount you can, and assist Stan in
    getting an appeal. Justice for Stan is our mission. Do you Stand with Stan? #IStandWithStan PAYPAL Donations: lisaromanek@yahoo.com Thank you, blessings, love and gratitude to you all!",https://fundrazr.com/d1HMsc
"4,751",Help Leewana heal -- get her back in action!,U.S. Dollar,,of $4.5k goal,103,"I must fight with all my strength so that the little positive
      things that my health allows me to do might be pointed toward
      helping the revolution. The only real reason for living. - Frida Kahlo *** Hey there! Wow. I didn’t realize how difficult this would be to write. I
    believe that we strengthen our communities and fight tyranny when we
    lift each other up. But it’s still not easy to admit that while I am
    fortunate and privileged in so many ways, I, Leewana, your friend,
    comrade, and co-conspirator, have a debilitating health condition.
    It’s even harder to add that because I want so desperately to be
    back in the trenches with you, I’m asking for your help. Ack, vulnerability! What’s going on? In case you don’t want to read the whole story... I have been
      suffering from debilitating migraines for the last year and would
      appreciate any help you can offer. You can donate once now, or
      choose a recurring donation that will last ONLY for the next four months . I have
      no preference, it's whatever works for you. If you want more detail, read on! For a little over a year, I’ve had a migraine almost every day. I started getting periodic migraines when I was 13 -- not fun,
    but manageable. Then last May, I flew backwards on a bus and got a
    concussion. My doctors think that it “triggered my pain systems,”
    and are hard at work to identify possible underlying conditions. All I know for sure is that it changed everything. Because migraines aren’t “visible,” it can be easy to diminish
    their impact. But the World Health Organization rates them as the 6th most debilitating health condition overall, and they take top honors among neurological conditions. This is a useful article about
      the full impact of migraine, from mental fuzziness to excruciating pain. For me, some days it’s “just” a headache. Those are among the
    days that I might be able to muster up energy to socialize or go to
    a meeting. But too often, my head throbs, I can’t stand, I feel dizzy,
    I’m nauseous, and all I can do is lie down in a dark room. In my darkest moments, it feels like migraines have completely
    taken over my life, and I doubt whether I’ll be able to do things
    like exercise, work full time, or socialize in groups ever again. I
    don’t think it’s a coincidence that migraines are strongly linked to
    depression and other mood disorders. I’ve become another medical debt sob story. In the initial aftermath of my concussion, I never imagined that
    I would still be in chronic pain over a year later. And when I was
    forced to stop working altogether in January, I had no idea that
    solving my headaches could take this much time, energy, and resources. I’ve tried remedies across the spectrum of Eastern and Western
    medicine, from acupuncture to magnesium to Botox. Unfortunately
    since the scientific community knows so little about migraines, most
    treatment plans are based on trial and error. By committing to put the necessary effort into feeling better,
    I’ve taken on a crippling amount of medical debt. Oh, the places I’d go without migraines holding me back. My medical debt is suffocating. But the hardest part of this
    ordeal is being forced to sit still for days, weeks, and months when
    there is so much work to do. I’m happy when I’m dancing with dear
    friends. I’m happy when I have enough energy to support my loved
    ones like they deserve. I am happiest fighting for a better world alongside all of you. I’ve been fortunate throughout the years to be surrounded by
    inspiring visionaries and doers. Over and over I’ve seen that righteously angry people can hack away at the seemingly inescapable power of the big banks, retail
    giants, a white supremacist government, and anything else they throw
    at us. I never dreamed that I would be forced to take such tremendous
    steps back from my work in the movement , from close friends, and also from many of the simple pleasures
    I enjoy in life. It’s been discouraging, but I am holding out hope
    that I can feel enough like myself again to get back to imagining
    and creating a more hopeful future for all of us. I am DETERMINED to get better. Like Frida, a fellow chronic pain sufferer, I am going to “ fight with all my strength” so that what “my health allows me to
    do might be pointed toward helping the revolution.” I’ve been trying
    to stay engaged in the struggle in small ways, and over the next few
    weeks I’m going to experiment with reconnecting with the work in a
    more part-time capacity. I hope that my contributions can get bigger
    and bigger as I continue treatment. A nd once I’m back, I intend to fight so that nobody else has to have the
      experience of choosing between financial security and health. There is some good news… In the past two months, I’ve developed a relationship with a
    leading neurologist and researcher at Mayo Clinic. It’s been refreshing to experience Mayo’s model of integrative
    health, and talk to doctors who can actually give me the time I
    need. With their support, I’m hoping to continue experimenting with
    new and unusual remedies to see what offers relief. Among these are CGRP inhibitor shots, Trigeminal Nerve devices,
    and transcranial magnetic stimulation. It’s too early for me to give
    out too much information without jinxing it… but Mayo doctors may
    have also found an underlying condition making my headaches worse.
    Fingers crossed! And now for the hard part … going beyond typical methods (which
    haven’t worked for me), and visiting top-notch medical institutions
    (when others can’t give me what I need) costs a lot of money. I’m
    lucky to have gotten support from my family, but we are at the end
    of our means. In order to continue down these treatment paths, and
    hopefully ultimately get relief, I need some kind of miracle. That’s why I’m reaching out to my beloved community. Because of insurance compatibility issues, the CGRP-inhibitor
    shot costs $650 per month. A “Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation” or
    “Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation” Device totals around $500, or
    $250 / month, depending on which I use. Continued visits to Mayo
    Clinic cost $400 - $500 each. And as mentioned above, I’ve
    accumulated thousands in medical debt over the last year. I’m not asking to cover my living costs, or even my entire
    medical costs. But any small dent you can help put in this sum,
    which totals from $800 - $1500 per month, is deeply felt. You can either donate in one chunk, or choose the option
        to spread it out over the next 4 months. All donations will go directly towards the medical costs I
    outlined above, or towards paying off prior medical debt. I am
    making it possible to donate on a recurring basis because some
    friends shared that they would like the option to spread out their
    donation over a few months... Do whatever feels best to you! My goal is to use this boost to dive into new treatments,
    and level out my costs as I discover what works. I will keep you
    consistently updated, and you can rescind a donation at any time. Without your help, I’m stuck, but with it, I know that I can
    continue on my path towards healing. Thank you. One thing I have taken away from this ordeal is a consistent
    gratitude practice. Even if I haven’t spoken to you in a while,
    chances are I’m thinking of you often as I consider circumstances,
    experiences, and people for which I am thankful. You’ve taught me the power of compassionate acts, and I hope
    you know that the next time you’re in need I want to be the first
    person you approach for support. Thank you for reading this far and for considering my requests,
    even as there are infinite worthy causes. Please don’t hesitate to
    contact me with questions, comments, poetry, kind words, etc :)
    Peace, love, & solidarity forever!",https://fundrazr.com/helpleewana
"1,174",Queer and Trans Health Fund,Canadian Dollar,,of $3k goal,14,"Hi my name is Otis, I am a queer transgender holistic bodyworker and
  acupuncturist, inspired to hold safe space for GLBTQTS folx in the
  traditional territories of the Songhees and Esquimalt First Nations. The creation of this Queer and Trans Bodywork Health Fund arose out
  of the needs of those in our community who struggle with stress,
  trauma, chronic pain, and a multitude of other health issues, and who
  need a place free from stigma to receive supportive care, and who
  cannot afford it. I started the Queer and Trans Bodywork Health Fund in 2018 during
  Pride to rally around this cause.  I haven't been able to give from
  the fund as much as every week.  I have been able to give about
  fifteen massages over one year at this point. My practice offers sessions at a sliding fee scale as an effort to
  create more accessibility, which also means that money from this fund
  will go farther than most other practices. The goal is set at $3000.00, but really any amount would be put to
  good use in this case and help the Q/T fund be sustainable. Here’s the breakdown $3000.00 will help 60 GLBTQTS community members This is a little over one a week for a year! This is calculated based
  on my low end of sliding scale fees for a massage sessions, which are
  $50 for massage and $60 for an Acupuncture/massage combo. Funds can also be used to subsidize clients session, making a session
  as low as $20 let’s say, and so in this way even more people will
  likely be benefiting from the fund. There are many on-going conversations happening in our city recently
  that identify a substantial need for accessible holistic healthcare as
  an issue in the transgender community.  I would like to be a part of
  creating more and more resources of this kind.  This Accessibility
  Fund is one step that can be taken right now in our current situation
  to work towards meeting this need for our community. We have set up incentives for donations if you wish to
    purchase services, crafts and other fun items, All proceeds from
    purchases go to the QT Fund. Unfortunately, we can’t do mail orders, purchases will be available
  for pickup.  We will email to arrange pickup time and pickup at my new
    location: 601 Superior St #2B, Victoria, BC (Superior and
    Government St) .  Email me if this is an accessibility issue. This is a first come first serve basis, as we are limited with these
  one of a kind donations from our generous community. If you can't donate, you can contribute by sharing this crowdfunding
  to your social media networks. Thank you very much for your support,
  every little bit counts. Otis",https://fundrazr.com/QTHealthFund
